econ,Methodological provisions for conducting empirical research of the availability and implementation of the consumers socially responsible intentions,"Social responsibility of consumers is one of the main conditions for the
recoupment of enterprises expenses associated with the implementation of social
and ethical marketing tasks. Therefore, the enterprises, which plan to act on
terms of social and ethical marketing, should monitor the social responsibility
of consumers in the relevant markets. At the same time, special attention
should be paid to the analysis of factors that prevent consumers from
implementing their socially responsible intentions in the regions with a low
level of social activity of consumers. The purpose of the article is to develop
methodological guidelines that determine the tasks and directions of conducting
empirical studies aimed at assessing the gap between the socially responsible
intentions of consumers and the actual implementation of these intentions, as
well as to identify the causes of this gap. An empirical survey of the sampled
consumers in Kharkiv was carried out in terms of the proposed methodological
provisions. It revealed a rather high level of respondents' willingness to
support socially responsible enterprises and a rather low level of
implementation of these intentions due to the lack of consumers awareness. To
test the proposed methodological guidelines, an empirical study of the
consumers social responsibility was conducted in 2017 on a sample of students
and professors of the Semen Kuznets Kharkiv National University of Economics
(120 people). Questioning of the respondents was carried out using the Google
Forms. The finding allowed to make conclusion for existence of a high level of
respondents' willingness to support socially responsible and socially active
enterprises. However, the study also revealed the existence of a significant
gap between the intentions and actions of consumers, caused by the lack of
awareness.","The purpose of this study is to describe the social-environmental context in which the consumer's intentions are perceived by the consumer, as well as its relationship to the environment. The results will be used to inform policy makers about the potential impact of the social-environmental context on the effectiveness of the consumer's intentions.

""The consumer knows that he/she will be punished if he/she does not
follow the consumer's instructions.""
The consumer's social responsibility intention (CSO) is defined as:
""The consumer knows that he/she will be punished if he/she does not follow
the consumer's instructions.""
The consumer's social responsibility intention (CSO) is derived from the
consumer's own behavior patterns such as how they behave when they are
inhibited by their behavior patterns.
The consumer's social responsibility intention (CSO) is obtained through
a combination of two types of assumptions: (i) the consumer may assume
that he/she is following his/her own behavior patterns; and (ii) there
is no evidence that the consumer is behaving in a socially responsible
way.
The consumer's CSO is assumed to be independent of the consumer's
behavior patterns.
The consumer's CSO is assumed to be non-negative at all times.
The consumer's CSO is assumed to be positive at all times.
The consumer's CSO is assumed to be zero at all times.

empirical research of the availability and implementation of the consumers
social responsibility intention. The research question is: How many consumers
are willing to purchase a product if they are aware of the social responsibility
of the company? This research will be conducted through a survey study among
consumers. The methodology consists of three steps: (1) identifying the
consumer's social responsibility intention, (2) conducting a survey about the
availability and implementation of the consumer's social responsibility intent,
and (3) analyzing the results of the survey.","The aim of this study is to provide a theoretical framework for conducting empirical research on the availability and implementation of consumer socially responsible intentions (CSRIs) in China. The main findings are as follows: 1) In the period from 2021 to 2022, there were more than 2 million people who had been socially responsible for their consumption; 2) There was an increase in the number of people with CSRIs; 3) People's participation in the social responsibility scheme increased from 0% in 2019 to 5% in 2020; 4) Compared with the previous years, the average number of people with CSRIs increased by 7%. This study provides a theoretical basis for conducting empirical research on the availability and implementation of the consumers socially responsible intentions (CSPI). It also provides practical recommendations for the implementation of CSPIs in China. We believe that the results of this study will help policymakers and policy makers in the future to implement CSPIs in China. Moreover, we hope that the results of this study could be used to inform the development of policies and programs to promote the adoption of CSPIs in China. Finally, we hope that the results of this study can serve as a guideline for the implementation of CSPIs in China.","The aim of this study is to examine the methodological aspects of the availability and implementation of the consumers socially responsible intentions. The study was conducted in two phases: a) an exploratory phase, where the availability and implementation of the consumers socially responsible intentions were examined; b) a confirmatory phase, where the results of the exploratory phase were used to develop a theoretical model that could be used to explain the availability and implementation of the consumers socially responsible intentions. The study included a total of 1,890 respondents from the general population (n = 1,890) and from the target group of the social enterprise (n = 1,890). The results of the exploratory phase showed that the availability and implementation of the consumers socially responsible intentions are not well understood by the general population or by the target group of the social enterprise. The results of the confirmatory phase showed that the availability and implementation of the consumers socially responsible intentions are explained by the theory of planned behavior. The results of the confirmatory phase also showed that the theory of planned behavior can be used to explain the availability and implementation of the consumers socially responsible intentions.Q:

We propose that this is done by using two different types of data: (1) observational studies where we observe what happens during market transactions; (2) experimental designs which use surveys with pre-defined questions about behavior before they occur. In both cases it can be difficult to identify causal relationships between variables because there may exist unobserved heterogeneity across participants who answer similar survey items but behave differently when asked about their intention to buy something. To address these issues researchers often rely upon instrumental variable analysis (IVA), i.e., identifying whether individuals' responses to certain questionnaires accurately predict individual behaviors. However IVAs have been criticized as being overly conservative due to potential endogeneity problems arising from confounding bias introduced through selection into treatment groups. This article proposes new methods based on Bayesian inference techniques such as latent class models to overcome some limitations associated with traditional approaches used in economics literature. The proposed methodology allows us not only to estimate conditional average effects over time periods but also to quantify uncertainty around them. Our results show evidence supporting our theoretical predictions regarding differences among countries in implementing consumer's Social Responsible Intentions at national level."
econ,Multitask Learning Deep Neural Networks to Combine Revealed and Stated Preference Data,"It is an enduring question how to combine revealed preference (RP) and stated
preference (SP) data to analyze travel behavior. This study presents a
framework of multitask learning deep neural networks (MTLDNNs) for this
question, and demonstrates that MTLDNNs are more generic than the traditional
nested logit (NL) method, due to its capacity of automatic feature learning and
soft constraints. About 1,500 MTLDNN models are designed and applied to the
survey data that was collected in Singapore and focused on the RP of four
current travel modes and the SP with autonomous vehicles (AV) as the one new
travel mode in addition to those in RP. We found that MTLDNNs consistently
outperform six benchmark models and particularly the classical NL models by
about 5% prediction accuracy in both RP and SP datasets. This performance
improvement can be mainly attributed to the soft constraints specific to
MTLDNNs, including its innovative architectural design and regularization
methods, but not much to the generic capacity of automatic feature learning
endowed by a standard feedforward DNN architecture. Besides prediction, MTLDNNs
are also interpretable. The empirical results show that AV is mainly the
substitute of driving and AV alternative-specific variables are more important
than the socio-economic variables in determining AV adoption. Overall, this
study introduces a new MTLDNN framework to combine RP and SP, and demonstrates
its theoretical flexibility and empirical power for prediction and
interpretation. Future studies can design new MTLDNN architectures to reflect
the speciality of RP and SP and extend this work to other behavioral analysis.","This paper presents a novel approach to learning deep neural networks, which is based on the use of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to combine information from multiple layers. The proposed method is applied to the data set of the first experiment in this paper. The results show that the proposed MLP can learn more than one layer with a single training step. The proposed method also learns an additional layer for each layer by combining the two layers. The proposed method has been tested on the data set of the second experiment in this paper.

Introduction
============

The goal of machine learning is to find out how well a given task will perform when it is learned. In many cases, such as classification or regression tasks, there are several ways to train models:

  * **Learning** : A model should be able to learn new features at once. This means that if you have already trained a model using only one input feature, then your model will not work anymore.

  * **Staging** : A model should be able to learn all possible combinations of inputs until it reaches its final state. This means that even if you have done some operations before, they will still fail because their output may not match the input’s expected value.

","The neural network (NN) is a powerful tool for learning from data where it
can learn information about many different types of inputs such as input
values, output values, and so on. It is widely used in computer vision,
computer vision, machine learning, image processing, and other fields.
It is often used in applications such as image recognition, video compression,
image classification, and speech recognition.
In addition, it is commonly used in deep learning algorithms to learn
information about hidden layers of neurons which are not fully connected
to each other. This type of NNs may provide useful insights into how well
information can be learned from unseen samples.

which combines the advantages of both supervised and unsupervised methods. We
present an algorithm that can be used in combination with existing state-of-the-art
multidimensional data augmentation techniques. The proposed method is
applied to two datasets: one from the United States Census Bureau's National Long
Term Care Survey (NLCS) dataset and another from the University Health Network
(UHN). Our results show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-arts
methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1 score. Moreover, we demonstrate
that it can be applied to any dataset with multiple features, including
multiple time series, and that it can also be combined with existing state-of-the-art
state-based approaches. Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis on how
multi-task learning can help improve the performance of existing machine learning
algorithms. This work is supported by NIH grant R01 GM049355. Code is available at this

econ,Selection and the Distribution of Female Hourly Wages in the U.S,"We analyze the role of selection bias in generating the changes in the
observed distribution of female hourly wages in the United States using CPS
data for the years 1975 to 2020. We account for the selection bias from the
employment decision by modeling the distribution of the number of working hours
and estimating a nonseparable model of wages. We decompose changes in the wage
distribution into composition, structural and selection effects. Composition
effects have increased wages at all quantiles while the impact of the
structural effects varies by time period and quantile. Changes in the role of
selection only appear at the lower quantiles of the wage distribution. The
evidence suggests that there is positive selection in the 1970s which
diminishes until the later 1990s. This reduces wages at lower quantiles and
increases wage inequality. Post 2000 there appears to be an increase in
positive sorting which reduces the selection effects on wage inequality.","The Federal Government's role in female work force development includes:

is one of the most important aspects of modern society. The current study
shows that there is no significant difference between men and women aged 20–39
years when selecting male hourly wages. The results indicate that it is not
necessary to select females whose hours do not exceed 30 minutes per week;
rather, they should be selected from those whom their average weekly wage does
not exceed $10,000.
In addition, the data shows that only about 10% of all workers at the end of
the year will be employed during the next 12 months. This means that if you
choose males which earn less than $10,000 each month, your earnings would be
less than $10,000.
This result indicates that even though many people choose young girls because
they enjoy being around them, some may choose younger ones because they feel
that having children is more important than working alone.
However, these findings suggest that choosing older individuals is still very
important but requires careful consideration before making any decisions.

steps now to address these issues before their impact becomes irreversible. In
particular, our findings show that policy changes could help reduce disparities
between genders through targeted policies such as paid maternity leave laws,
more flexible work schedules, more equitable scheduling practices, greater job
search assistance programs, etc., which would likely lead to higher overall
wages."

is characterized by a high level of heterogeneity, with the most common
institutions being the United States (US) and the European Union (EU). In
addition, the institutional economics of collective waste recovery systems is
characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity, with the US being the most
common institution. This study provides a theoretical framework for understanding
the institutional economics of collective waste recovery systems. It also
provides a conceptual model for the empirical analysis of the institutional
economies of collective waste recovery systems. Our results show that the
heterogeneity in the institutional economics of collective waste recovery systems
can be explained by a combination of the institutional economics of the
individuals and the institutional economics of the institutions. Furthermore,
our findings suggest that the institutional economics of collective waste
recovery systems can be explained by the institutional economics of the
collective population. Finally, we provide a theoretical framework for the
empirical analysis of the institutional economies of collective waste recovery
systems.","The paper presents a new approach to the analysis of collective waste recovery systems. The approach is based on the idea that the economic value of a system can be measured by the amount of waste it can recover, and that the cost of waste recovery can be decomposed into the costs of the individual components of the system. The paper shows that the decomposition of the total cost of a system into the costs of the individual components leads to a more accurate estimation of the economic value of the system. The paper also shows that the decomposition of the total cost of a system into the costs of the individual components does not lead to a more accurate estimation of the economic value of the system. This is because the decomposition of the total cost of a system into the costs of the individual components depends on the way in which the system is designed. In particular, the decomposition of the total cost of a system into the costs of the individual components may lead to an overestimation of the economic value of the system. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the results for the design of collective waste recovery systems.

systems (CWR). We use a unique dataset on CWR operations in Germany to study how,
when and why they are organized. The data set includes information about all
operations from 2010 until 2019 as well as detailed analyses for each operation.
We find that there is no clear pattern regarding whether or not these systems have
a clearly defined purpose; however, we do observe some commonalities across them.
For example, both municipal solid waste collection services and recycling centers
are used by many municipalities. However, while most cities collect their own
solid waste at home, only few city authorities manage it themselves. In addition,
the number of staff employed varies widely among different types of facilities.
Finally, our analysis shows that although public procurement rules vary greatly
across regions within one municipality, this does not necessarily mean that such
rules exist everywhere else. This suggests that local policy makers should be more
aware when making decisions concerning which type of facility will receive funding
in order to ensure effective coordination between neighboring communities. Our
analysis also reveals important differences with respect to financing sources
and management strategies."
econ,Modeling Dynamic Transport Network with Matrix Factor Models: with an Application to International Trade Flow,"International trade research plays an important role to inform trade policy
and shed light on wider issues relating to poverty, development, migration,
productivity, and economy. With recent advances in information technology,
global and regional agencies distribute an enormous amount of internationally
comparable trading data among a large number of countries over time, providing
a goldmine for empirical analysis of international trade. Meanwhile, an array
of new statistical methods are recently developed for dynamic network analysis.
However, these advanced methods have not been utilized for analyzing such
massive dynamic cross-country trading data. International trade data can be
viewed as a dynamic transport network because it emphasizes the amount of goods
moving across a network. Most literature on dynamic network analysis
concentrates on the connectivity network that focuses on link formation or
deformation rather than the transport moving across the network. We take a
different perspective from the pervasive node-and-edge level modeling: the
dynamic transport network is modeled as a time series of relational matrices.
We adopt a matrix factor model of \cite{wang2018factor}, with a specific
interpretation for the dynamic transport network. Under the model, the observed
surface network is assumed to be driven by a latent dynamic transport network
with lower dimensions. The proposed method is able to unveil the latent dynamic
structure and achieve the objective of dimension reduction. We applied the
proposed framework and methodology to a data set of monthly trading volumes
among 24 countries and regions from 1982 to 2015. Our findings shed light on
trading hubs, centrality, trends and patterns of international trade and show
matching change points to trading policies. The dataset also provides a fertile
ground for future research on international trade.","This paper presents a novel approach to modeling dynamic transport networks.

a) a transport network consisting of a network of nodes connected by links;
b) a transport network composed of many other networks which are interconnected
by edges. The most common type of transportation system is the so-called
traffic flow network where each node is connected to all other nodes via a
network of links. The purpose of this paper is to develop a new approach to
the transport network problem based on matrix factor models. The key idea is to
define a set of matrices representing the connectivity between any two nodes at
least one link from each edge connecting them. This allows us to define a
matrix factor model for the transport network without having to specify how it
works. The resulting model provides a simple framework for studying the
transport properties of such systems.
In addition, the proposed model enables us to study the effect of different
parameters on the behavior of the transport network when varying the number
of links involved.
We will discuss the results obtained through our numerical simulations below.

The DTN can be modeled as the sum of its constituent parts or by using matrix factor models that allow for non-linear relationships among variables in different dimensions. In this paper we propose two methods based on these ideas which are applied to international trade flows data from 1990 through 2019 at global level. We first use multivariate time series analysis techniques such as principal component regression combined with partial least squares regressions to model interdependence between countries' exports over space while accounting for country heterogeneity. Then our second method uses machine learning algorithms including random forest classifiers trained via gradient boosted decision trees algorithm coupled with elastic net regularization term to predict future export values given their historical levels. Both approaches show good performance compared against other alternative modeling strategies used previously but also highlight some limitations related to both thematic dimensionality reduction technique employed here and lack of availability of high quality datasets during study period. Our results suggest potential benefits of incorporating more detailed information about individual factors into economic analyses when dealing with large scale systems like those found within DTNs. However further research should focus on developing better prediction tools able to deal with larger amounts of available input/outputs data than currently possible."
econ,The Impact Of Country Of Origin In Mobile Phone Choice Of Generation Y And Z,"Mobile phones play a very important role in our life. Mobile phone sales have
been soaring over the last decade due to the growing acceptance of
technological innovations, especially by Generations Y and Z. Understanding the
change in customers' requirement is the key to success in the smartphone
business. New, strong mobile phone models will emerge if the voice of the
customer can be heard. Although it has been widely known that country of origin
has serious impact on the attitudes and purchase decisions of mobile phone
consumers, there lack substantial studies that investigate the mobile phone
preference of young adults aged 18-25, members of late Generation Y and early
Generation Z. In order to investigate the role of country of origin in mobile
phone choice of Generations Y and Z, an online survey with 228 respondents was
conducted in Hungary in 2016. Besides the descriptive statistical methods,
crosstabs, ANOVA and Pearson correlation are used to analyze the collected data
and find out significant relationships. Factor analysis (Principal Component
Analysis) is used for data reduction to create new factor components. The
findings of this exploratory study support the idea that country of origin
plays a significant role in many respects related to young adults' mobile phone
choice. Mobile phone owners with different countries of origin attribute
crucial importance to the various product features including technical
parameters, price, design, brand name, operating system, and memory size.
Country of origin has a moderating effect on the price sensitivity of consumers
with varied net income levels. It is also found that frequent buyers of mobile
phones, especially US brand products, spend the most significant amount of
money for their consumption in this aspect.","The impact of country of origin in mobile phone choice of generation y and z is a major issue for the future of mobile phones. The impact on the market will be very significant, as it will affect the way that users choose their own phones to use them.

(1) the generation of a new cell phone number from the original one;
(2) the creation of a new cell phone number at random over a period of time.
The key concept behind the generation mechanism is that each user's
cell phone number will change according to the changes in their own
numberplate. This means that if they are not able to pick up a new cell
phone within a given time period, they will lose all information about it.
This phenomenon is called the country of origin problem.
The country of origin problem is defined as follows:
A cell phone number consists of three parts:
1. the name of the customer who owns the particular cell phone which he
has chosen;
2. the location of the selected cell telephone number;
3. the type of service provided by the customer whose call originated
from his home area;
the amount of time spent waiting for the caller to pick up the next
cell phone when there is no available space between the calling party
and the destination station.
The country of origin problem may involve many different types of cells
and thus requires some kind of knowledge of how these cells were created.

phone market is driven by the increasing popularity of mobile phones among
young people who are more likely to use mobile phones than older people.

generation from which one chooses a mobile phone. The study is based on
the analysis of the mobile phone market in China, India, and the United
States. The results show that the choice of generation affects the choice of
mobile phone brand. The results also show that the choice of generation
affects the choice of mobile phone brand when the consumer's age is between
18 and 30 years old.","In this paper, we study the impact of country of origin (COI) on mobile

0.071. Our results show that the COI has a significant effect on the choice of
the generation number of the US population. Moreover, our findings suggest

This research contributes new insights into understanding why some people adopt certain technologies whereas others do not. It also provides evidence about which aspects should be considered when designing digital interventions aimed at changing behavior patterns related to technological change.

econ,Nonparametric Instrumental Variables Estimation Under Misspecification,"Nonparametric Instrumental Variables (NPIV) analysis is based on a
conditional moment restriction. We show that if this moment condition is even
slightly misspecified, say because instruments are not quite valid, then NPIV
estimates can be subject to substantial asymptotic error and the identified set
under a relaxed moment condition may be large. Imposing strong a priori
smoothness restrictions mitigates the problem but induces bias if the
restrictions are too strong. In order to manage this trade-off we develop a
methods for empirical sensitivity analysis and apply them to the consumer
demand data previously analyzed in Blundell (2007) and Horowitz (2011).",The instrument is a,"The nonparametric instrumentality estimation problem under misspecified
variables may not be tractably solved analytically. This issue arises from the
problem of how to estimate parameters such as velocity dispersion, pressure
pressure gradient, etc. It is therefore desirable to develop a method which
can handle these missing unknown parameters without resorting to numerical
calculations.
In this paper, we propose a method based on the nonparametric instrumentality
estimation problem where the parameter estimates are estimated via Monte Carlo
methods. The method consists of two steps: (i) estimating the parameters at
the beginning of the simulation; and (ii) solving the resulting system of
elements. The main idea of the method is to use the information about the
initial conditions given by the data points to approximate the solution over
time. The main advantage of the method is that it does not require any prior
information about the initial conditions but only provides accurate estimates of
the parameters when they are known.
We demonstrate the method through simulations of a simple example consisting of
a set of three coupled nonlinear systems whose initial conditions are specified
by the following variables:
(1) the velocity field $\bm{v}_0$ and","The estimation of nonparametric instrumental variables under misspecification
has attracted much attention recently. In this paper, we consider the

We develop a new nonparametric estimator which is based on the
nonparametric instrumental variable estimator proposed by @hastie2009introduction.
The proposed estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically
correct when the true parameter values are known.","Instrumental variables are commonly used to estimate the parameters of a model
in order to estimate the parameters of the model. In this paper, we propose an
implementation of instrumental variable estimation under misspecification. We
propose a novel approach for estimating instrumental variables under misspecified
variables. The proposed method is based on the assumption that the observed
variable is normally distributed and has a normal distribution. It is shown that
the estimator of the instrumental variable is unbiased and can be estimated
under misspecified variables. Furthermore, we show that the estimator of the
measure of the instrumental variable is unbiased and can be estimated under
misspecified variables. Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
estimated instrumental variable under misspecified variables. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be applied in various settings
including estimation of the instrumental variable under misspecified variables.

deriving the instrumental variable estimators under misspecified variables. This
method is applicable to any parametric instrument with missing data.","
This paper presents a new method for estimating nonparametric instrumental variables (IV) under misspecification. The method is based on the idea of using the IV estimator to estimate the misspecified distribution of the IV, and then using the estimated misspecified distribution to estimate the misspecified IVs. The proposed method is applied to the problem of estimating the misspecified IV in the presence of misspecifying covariates. The proposed method is shown to be asymptotically efficient when the misspecifications are mild. Simulation studies show that the proposed method is more accurate than existing methods such as the bootstrap and the maximum likelihood estimator. The proposed method is also shown to be robust to misspecications of the covariates.
The proposed method is illustrated by an application to the estimation of the misspecified IV from a data set with misspecifiable covariates. The proposed method is compared with the bootstrap and the maximum likelihood estimator. The results show that the proposed method is more accurate than the bootstrap and the maximum likelihood estimator.
We have developed software for implementing the proposed method. The software is available at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jyun/software.html.","In this paper, we consider the estimation of a non-parametric instrumental
variables (NPIV) model with misspecification. We propose an NPIV estimator that
is based on two steps: firstly estimating unobserved confounders and then using
the estimated variables to estimate causal effects in both treatment groups; our
estimator is asymptotically normal even when there are no observed units for
treatment assignment or control group selection. The proposed method can be used
to study multiple types of data such as panel studies where only some subjects
are treated but others receive controls. In addition, it has been shown by other
authors that if one uses propensity score matching methods instead of inverse
probability weighting techniques, results may not hold under missing values. To
address these issues, I develop new methodology called""misspecified imputation
methods""that allows us to use any existing algorithms like doubly robust mean
and variance adjustment without needing additional information about covariates.
Theoretical properties of my approach have also been studied through simulations
and real datasets from various fields including economics, medicine, social
science, etc., which show its superiority over previous approaches."
econ,Conditions for the uniqueness of the Gately point for cooperative games,"We are studying the Gately point, an established solution concept for
cooperative games. We point out that there are superadditive games for which
the Gately point is not unique, i.e. in general the concept is rather
set-valued than an actual point. We derive conditions under which the Gately
point is guaranteed to be a unique imputation and provide a geometric
interpretation. The Gately point can be understood as the intersection of a
line defined by two points with the set of imputations. Our uniqueness
conditions guarantee that these two points do not coincide. We provide
demonstrative interpretations for negative propensities to disrupt. We briefly
show that our uniqueness conditions for the Gately point include quasibalanced
games and discuss the relation of the Gately point to the $\tau$-value in this
context. Finally, we point out relations to cost games and the ACA method and
end upon a few remarks on the implementation of the Gately point and an

are able to control their own behavior without any interference from other
players. This condition allows them to play cooperatively when they are not
playing at all. It is known that if one player is allowed to play at least
one game over a given period of time, then it is possible to establish a
convergence result for the number of times played. This phenomenon occurs
when there is no interaction between two players. In such cases, the system
can only evolve once every few seconds.
In addition, the existence of a unique Gately point implies that each player
has access to information about his environment which may be useful for
mechanical analysis.

existence of the Gately point is proved by showing that the Gately point is
unique if and only if the number of agents is finite. In particular, we show
that the Gately point is unique if and only if the number of agents is
numerically large. Finally, we provide conditions under which the Gately point
is unique. These conditions are satisfied by the Gately point in the
general case. Our results are applied to the problem of finding the Gately point
for cooperative games in which the players are agents with a finite number of
agents. For the general case, we show that the Gately point is unique if and only
if the number of agents is infinite. This result is also used to prove the

a cost. The game is played on some graph (e.g., complete bipartite) such that no
player can gain more than her opponent's payoff by taking actions in any cycle; we
call this property""cooperative equilibrium"". We show how to construct graphs
such as those used above so that if all cycles are unique then there exists at
least one co-cycle which satisfies these conditions: it must contain every edge
of its own component plus two edges incident to both components of another player
(called their common neighbor). This result holds even when playing against other
players who may have different strategies or payoffs from our original set of
equilibrium rules. In particular, under certain assumptions about play between
the same pairs of agents, including symmetry, monotonicity, transitivity, etc.,
we prove existence of multiple equilibria satisfying cooperation equilibrium
conditions. Our main technical contribution is showing that finding new sets of
rules whose associated subgraphs satisfy cooperate equilibrium properties gives
rise to polynomial time algorithms."
econ,Shrinkage for Categorical Regressors,"This paper introduces a flexible regularization approach that reduces point
estimation risk of group means stemming from e.g. categorical regressors,
(quasi-)experimental data or panel data models. The loss function is penalized
by adding weighted squared l2-norm differences between group location
parameters and informative first-stage estimates. Under quadratic loss, the
penalized estimation problem has a simple interpretable closed-form solution
that nests methods established in the literature on ridge regression,
discretized support smoothing kernels and model averaging methods. We derive
risk-optimal penalty parameters and propose a plug-in approach for estimation.
The large sample properties are analyzed in an asymptotic local to zero
framework by introducing a class of sequences for close and distant systems of
locations that is sufficient for describing a large range of data generating
processes. We provide the asymptotic distributions of the shrinkage estimators
under different penalization schemes. The proposed plug-in estimator uniformly
dominates the ordinary least squares in terms of asymptotic risk if the number
of groups is larger than three. Monte Carlo simulations reveal robust
improvements over standard methods in finite samples. Real data examples of
estimating time trends in a panel and a difference-in-differences study
illustrate potential applications.",This is a discussion,"The Shrubage method is one of the most widely used statistical models

the covariance matrix of the data. The shrinkage estimator is obtained by
applying a linear transformation to the covariance matrix of the data. The

data. The shrinkage estimator is shown to be consistent under mild conditions.
The proposed algorithm is tested on both synthetic and real data sets.","We propose a new class of categorical regressors that are not necessarily
categorizable as categorical regressors. We show that the proposed

that it can be used to classify the data in a way that is robust to the
outliers. The proposed methods are also shown to be effective at identifying
the outliers in the data, and can be applied to other types of data. Finally, we

Q:

How to get the value of an element in a list?

I have a list of elements like this:
list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

I want to get the value of the element 1 (the first element) but I don't know how to do it.

A:

You can use map function with a lambda function:

>>> map(lambda x: x+1, lst)
[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]","We consider the problem of shrinkage estimation in regression models with a
categorical response variable. We show that, under some mild conditions on the
error distribution and covariance matrix (e.g., boundedness), we can obtain an asymptotic
normality result: if $X$ is any random vector such that $\mathbb{E}(|X|) = \sigma^2$, then its sample mean converges to zero almost surely. This allows us to estimate both parameters by their means without estimating them separately from data or using other methods like bootstrap inference. In particular, our method does not require knowledge about how many observations are needed to achieve this convergence rate; it only requires knowing what number of samples one needs to use when performing standard statistical tests. Our results apply equally well to linear regressions where there is no error term but also hold true more generally for nonlinear ones. The proposed estimator has several attractive properties including consistency, efficiency, simplicity, robustness against outliers, flexibility, etc. Moreover, unlike existing approaches based solely on Monte Carlo simulations, ours do not rely upon prior assumptions regarding model misspecification nor need additional computational resources be allocated during training time."

###","Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly involved in the development of new
drugs and vaccines. This involves both the design and testing of new drugs and
vaccines before they are approved for use. The pharmaceutical industry is
increasingly concerned about the potential for drug resistance and the
potential for adverse effects from these new drugs and vaccines.
In response to these concerns, the pharmaceutical industry has developed
strategies to reduce the risk of drug resistance and adverse effects. One such
strategy is to develop new drugs and vaccines that are more effective than
those currently available. Another strategy is to develop new vaccines that
are less likely to cause adverse effects.
To achieve these goals, the pharmaceutical industry has developed new
methodologies to evaluate the effectiveness of new drugs and vaccines. One
such methodology is the use of mathematical models to predict the effect of
new drugs and vaccines on the health of the population. These models are
developed based on the assumption that the efficacy of a new drug or vaccine
is related to the number of people who are protected against the disease.
However, there are many factors that can affect the success of a new drug or

of 1,000 randomly selected individuals living in Mexico City (the capital) who are
partly or fully covered under one of three different types of social security

We found evidence supporting two main findings: first, there have been significant
changes over time regarding both availability and quality of essential medications
in pharmacies across these insurance schemes since 2000 when they were introduced;
second, while some aspects such as medication prices remain stable between years,
others like prescription coverage rates vary significantly among them. We also find
that although most people use their private plan at least once during each year,
only about half of those with government assistance actually obtain needed care
from pharmacists. Our results suggest that more than just price changes can affect
accessibility to healthcare services but other factors may be equally important."
econ,Modeling tax distribution in metropolitan regions with PolicySpace,"Brazilian executive body has consistently vetoed legislative initiatives
easing creation and emancipation of municipalities. The literature lists
evidence of the negative results of municipal fragmentation, especially so for

metropolitan union, this paper quantifies the quality of life of metropolitan
citizens in the face of four alternative rules of distribution of municipal tax

the progressiveness of the Municipal Participation Fund and its relevance to a
better quality of life in metropolitan municipalities is confirmed. Second,
municipal financial merging would improve citizens' quality of life, compared
to the status quo for 23 Brazilian metropolises. Further, the paper presents
quantitative evidence that allows comparing alternative tax distributions for
each of the 40 simulated metropolises, identifying more efficient forms of
fiscal distribution and contributing to the literature and to contemporary
parliamentary debate.","The tax distribution model is a useful tool for planning and forecasting.

in urban areas. This makes it difficult to accurately model city size growth
through the use of policy space. To address this issue, we propose a new
policy space formulation which allows us to incorporate both local and global
distributions. Specifically, we introduce a policy space formulation where
the density function $f(x)$ of each point $x\in{\mathbb{R}}^n$ is given by
$$f(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{+\infty}e^{-t}dt \quad \text{with } t>0.$$
This approach enables us to obtain accurate estimates of the parameters $\alpha_k$,
$k=1,2,3,\ldots$ through numerical simulations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by simulating real city sizes at various
locality levels. We find that our approach provides good results when compared
to the state-of-the-art methods such as the KdV, NLS and the Allen-Cahn
equations.
In addition, we show that our approach can be extended to other types of","Taxes are a key component of the urban planning process. The tax system is

Introduction
============

Sanitation is one of the most important health problems for many countries around the world. In developing countries, it is estimated that more than half of all deaths occur due to inadequate sanitation [@bib1]. In addition, there are significant disparities in access to safe and clean water, as well as increased costs related to food and fuel consumption [@bib2].

In developed countries, poor sanitation is often linked to high rates of mortality and morbidity from infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, cholera, typhoid fever, and diarrhoea [@bib3], [@bib4]. In some parts of Africa, where hygiene is not yet established, this problem is particularly prevalent [@bib5].

In Nigeria, which has been experiencing rapid population growth since the 1980s","The community matters approach uses the following two types of models:
(a) heterogeneous impacts; these are those where there is no direct impact
on the environment but some indirect effects such as pollution, noise,
etc. These may be treated as independent processes which interact through
the interaction between the environment and the population.
(b) heterogeneous impacts due to environmental factors such as air pollution,
pollution, etc. These interactions may be described by a set of coupled
systems including many interacting systems.
In this paper, we consider three different types of impacts from each type of
impact: (i) direct impacts caused by pollutants, (ii) indirect impacts induced
by other sources of pollution, and (iii) indirect impacts induced by other
source conditions.
We will focus on direct impacts because they are more likely to occur when
there is little influence at all on the environment. We will discuss how
these influences affect the system under study here.
We will use the following definitions:
(i) Direct impacts cause only one change in the environment while indirect
effects induce changes in the environment via another process called
disruption.
(ii) Indirect impacts cause both direct and indirect effects upon the same
environment","This paper presents a case study of a community intervention project involving

community-based sanitation intervention on the health and well-being of
children in the United States. The intervention was implemented by the US Department
of Health, Education & Welfare (HEW) through its Community Action Plan for Children
(CAP). This program aims to improve the quality of life of children in the US by
improving the availability of food and water, improving the quality of life of
custodians, and improving the quality of life of children in the United States. In
particular, CAP aims to increase access to sanitation services, improve the
quality of life of children, and improve the quality of life of children in the
United States. We conducted a qualitative study using focus groups with
participants from the community. A total of 716 participants were included in our
study. Participants were recruited through online surveys and snowballing. They
were interviewed by two researchers who were trained in qualitative research. Two
experts were trained in quantitative methods. Both researchers used thematic
analysis techniques to analyze the data. Our results show that the intervention

The intervention consisted of a community-wide campaign that included a variety of activities, including the distribution of handwashing stations, the installation of water fountains, and the distribution of soap dispensers. The study used a quasi-experimental design with pre- and post-intervention data collected from a convenience sample of households in the intervention area. The results indicated that the intervention had a positive impact on the health and well-being of residents. The intervention was associated with a significant increase in the number of handwashing stations installed, a decrease in the number of open defecation sites, and a decrease in the number of open defecation sites per household. The intervention also resulted in a significant increase in the number of soap dispensers distributed, a decrease in the number of open defecation sites per household, and a decrease in the number of open defecation sites per household.

debated. However, the heterogeneity in impacts across communities is rarely

level surveys with multiple indicators for each type of community. Our results
reveal that there are significant differences between these two groups when it

largely attributed to individual characteristics such as age at first birth, sex,
and residence status. These findings highlight important opportunities for future
interventions targeting specific populations based on local context factors. In
particular, our work suggests targeted messaging campaigns could help reduce food
insecurity among women living near water points by increasing access to safe
water sources during pregnancy. Further research should explore whether this
strategy would also improve infant health outcomes through improved nutrition
during infancy. Finally, we discuss potential policy implications related to the
potential benefits associated with reducing poverty while simultaneously improving
children's nutritional well being. This study provides new insights into what may

econ,Mastering Panel 'Metrics: Causal Impact of Democracy on Growth,"The relationship between democracy and economic growth is of long-standing
interest. We revisit the panel data analysis of this relationship by Acemoglu,
Naidu, Restrepo and Robinson (forthcoming) using state of the art econometric
methods. We argue that this and lots of other panel data settings in economics
are in fact high-dimensional, resulting in principal estimators -- the fixed
effects (FE) and Arellano-Bond (AB) estimators -- to be biased to the degree
that invalidates statistical inference. We can however remove these biases by
using simple analytical and sample-splitting methods, and thereby restore valid
statistical inference. We find that the debiased FE and AB estimators produce
substantially higher estimates of the long-run effect of democracy on growth,
providing even stronger support for the key hypothesis in Acemoglu, Naidu,
Restrepo and Robinson (forthcoming). Given the ubiquitous nature of panel data,
we conclude that the use of debiased panel data estimators should substantially
improve the quality of empirical inference in economics.","The impact of democracy on growth is a topic that has been around for many years.

on how much they agree with them about the impact of democracy on their

applied to the United States, China, and India. The results show that
democracies are more likely to increase their growth rates than non-democracies.

largely due to the positive impact of democracy on the growth of the

democracy on growth. We consider a panel of countries with a wide range of
political and economic outcomes, including democracy, authoritarianism,
corruption, and authoritarianism-based governance. The panel is composed of
individuals who are members of a political party, and each member is assigned
a set of metrics that measure the impact of their political party on the
growth of the country. These metrics are used to assess the impact of
democratization on the country's growth. Our results show that the panel can
be used as an instrument for assessing the impact of democracy on growth. In
addition, we also provide evidence that the panel can be used as a tool for
evaluating the impact of democracy on growth. Finally, our analysis shows that
the panel can be used as a proxy for the impact of democracy on growth. This

The method is based on the idea that, in a democracy, people are more likely to be satisfied with their lives and less likely to be dissatisfied if they have better access to information about what others think or do. This leads to a positive correlation between democracy and growth. We show that this relationship can be measured using a simple model which assumes that people are more likely to be satisfied with their lives if they know how other people feel about them. In addition, we show that our model predicts an increase in the growth rate of the economy when there is a high level of trust in the government.

democracy are associated with lower growth over time but also suggest some
interesting patterns when we look at individual years or periods within each
country's history. For example, there is evidence suggesting that democratic
governments have been more effective than authoritarian regimes during times of
economic stress; however this effect reverses after recovery has occurred. In
addition, our analysis suggests that democracies may be less successful as they
are transitioning into new phases of their histories -- such as post Cold War
times -- where political stability might not exist anymore. Overall these findings
suggest that it would be beneficial if policymakers could take advantage of past
experiences by promoting greater transparency about how well policies work under
democracies while taking steps towards reducing inequality through targeted tax
policy measures. Our paper provides novel insights regarding what causes long term
growth effects of democratization which can inform policy making strategies aimed

econ,Fuzzy Profit Shifting: A Model for Optimal Tax-induced Transfer Pricing with Fuzzy Arm's Length Parameter,"This paper proposes a model of optimal tax-induced transfer pricing with a
fuzzy arm's length parameter. Fuzzy numbers provide a suitable structure for
modelling the ambiguity that is intrinsic to the arm's length parameter. For
the usual conditions regarding the anti-shifting mechanisms, the optimal
transfer price becomes a maximising $\alpha$-cut of the fuzzy arm's length
parameter. Nonetheless, we show that it is profitable for firms to choose any
maximising transfer price if the probability of tax audit is sufficiently low,
even if the chosen price is considered a completely non-arm's length price by
tax authorities. In this case, we derive the necessary and sufficient
conditions to prevent this extreme shifting strategy","The fuzzy profit shifting model is a simple, flexible, and efficient way to model the transfer pricing of a tax. It can be used to model the transfer pricing of a tax in a wide variety of ways. For example, it can be used to model the transfer pricing of a tax on a single tax unit (e.g., a car) or an individual tax unit (i.e., a house). The fuzzy profit shifting model also has many advantages over the traditional fuzzy economic model. For example, it can be used to model the transfer pricing of a tax by using the fuzzy profit shifting model as a base model. In addition, it can be used to model the transfer pricing of a tax at a fixed rate based on the number of units that are taxed. This allows the fuzzy profit shifting model to be used to model the transfer pricing of a tax when the tax is not being taxed.

allows one to efficiently implement a fuzzy profit shift algorithm based on
the fuzzy product rule. This approach allows one to efficiently implement
a fuzzy profit shift algorithm without having to resort to any additional
calculating steps. The fuzzy profit shift algorithm is implemented using
fuzzy product rules. It is shown that the fuzzy profit shift algorithm
can be implemented efficiently within a few hours.
In addition, the fuzzy profit shift algorithm is able to handle many
different types of trade-offs such as price changes, cost increases,
cost decreases, and so forth.
The fuzzy profit shift algorithm is designed to be flexible and adaptable
to different types of trade-offs. For example, it can be adapted to
trade-offs between two prices at the same time.
The fuzzy profit shift algorithm is presented here for use in a
particular application where there are many different types of trade-offs.

optimization problem. The objective is to maximize the revenue obtained from
transfers between two firms while minimizing the cost incurred by the firms.
The optimal solution is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem over
the set of all possible arm's length parameters. The problem is solved using
the fuzzy profit shifting (FPSh) model. The FPSh model is a hybrid of the
conventional profit shifting (PS) model and the fuzzy profit function. The
model is based on the idea that the optimal arm's length parameter is a
fuzzy number which is determined by the firm's decision making process. The
model is extended to incorporate the fuzzy profit function. The model is
extensively tested on real world data sets.","We propose a novel framework to model the transfer pricing problem in which
the seller is required to choose between two different types of transfers. We
propose an efficient algorithm that can be used to efficiently compute the
transfer prices of all possible combinations of transfers. The proposed method
is based on a simple and efficient algorithm, called fuzzy profit shifting (FFS),
which is shown to be asymptotically optimal under certain conditions. Our main
result is that the proposed approach is asymptotically optimal under some
conditions. In particular, we show that the proposed algorithm is asymptotically
optimal under the following conditions: (i) it is asymptotically optimal under
some conditions; (ii) it is asymptotically optimal under some conditions; (iii)
it is asymptotically optimal under some conditions; (iv) it is asymptotically
optimally under some conditions. Moreover, we provide a sufficient condition
for the proposed algorithm to achieve the desired performance. Finally, we

The model is based on the idea that the optimal tax rate depends on the amount of the firm's capital and the risk aversion of the firm, which are both functions of the firm's capital. The model also includes a fuzzy profit shifting mechanism to account for the fact that the firm's capital may be subject to tax at different rates. The model is applied to the case of a firm with a fixed capital structure and a risk-averse investor. The results show that the optimal tax rate is lower than the optimal tax rate obtained by the conventional model when the firm's capital is subject to tax at different rates. In addition, the optimal tax rate obtained by the proposed model is higher than the optimal tax rate obtained by the conventional model when the firm's capital is subject to tax at the same rate.Q:

Finally, our theoretical analysis provides insights into why some countries have adopted this type of taxation scheme while others do not.

remunerations as low as few cents. Instrumental to the development of today's

casualization already observed in ""uberized"" workers. The present article uses
the results of the DiPLab study to estimate the number of people who microwork

different modes of engagement: a group of 14,903 ""very active"" microworkers,

once a month; a third circle of 266,126 ""casual"" microworkers, more
heterogeneous and who alternate inactivity and various levels of work practice.
Our results show that microwork is comparable to, and even larger than, the
workforce of ride-sharing and delivery platforms in France. It is therefore not
an anecdotal phenomenon and deserves great attention from researchers, unions
and policy-makers.","

industries but they remain low compared to other countries such as Germany or
Italy. The analysis also allows us to quantify differences between sectors and
between industries within sectors (e.g., construction vs manufacturing). Our
results suggest that there may be significant heterogeneity among firms' sizes
and types of activities carried out during working hours. This suggests that
firms might have different strategies when it comes to managing their human
resources. In particular, some companies could specialize more than others in
managing employees' time while maintaining high levels of productivity. These
findings highlight important questions regarding firm management practices and
their impact on company performance. They raise concerns over whether current

one and two factors models comprising one single stock (capital wealth) and one
single flow factor (labour) as pure drivers of income and wealth generation and
allocation over time. Second, we introduce heuristic modes of taxation in line
with the baseline approach. Our computational economic analysis corroborates
that the financial accumulation process featuring compound returns plays a
significant role as source of inequality, while institutional arrangements
including taxation play a significant role in framing and shaping the aggregate
economic process that evolves over socioeconomic space and time.","The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present the main results of this paper.

","The inequality problem arises from the fact that if one wishes to obtain a
good approximation of the distribution function at any given time step, it
must be possible to find a suitable solution which satisfies the inequality
problem. This approach allows us to derive analytical results about how much
difference between the distributions will occur when solving the inequality
problem. The main advantage of this approach is that it does not require knowledge
of the underlying system but only provides approximate solutions.
This makes it possible to study the behavior of the entire system without having to
know what particular parameters are involved.

economics. The financial accumulation process is defined as the process where
the wealth of a society is accumulated over time. The financial accumulation
process is driven by the growth of the wealth of a society. The financial
accumulation process is closely related to the growth of the wealth of a
society. The financial accumulation process is often modeled by the so called
financial market model. The financial market model is a mathematical model which
describes the relationship between the wealth of a society and the price of
money. The financial market model is widely used in economics because it is
easy to use and easy to understand. The financial market model is based on the
assumption that the wealth of a society is proportional to the price of money.
The financial market model is usually formulated as a stochastic differential
equation (SDE). The financial market model is commonly used to describe the

the number of nodes and the size of the network. This approximation method

two main mechanisms through which individuals can shape their own trajectories
of consumption over time - one being social influence (through peers) and another
being personal choice/preferences for certain goods. In addition we also provide
an analytical framework explaining why some agents experience higher levels of
inequality than others when it comes to wealth distribution across countries. Our
analysis shows that while both types of mechanism operate simultaneously, only
the former dominates overall outcomes due to its greater impact on aggregate
wealth distributions compared to other potential drivers like technology adoption
and migration patterns. This finding suggests policymakers should focus more on
improving access to education rather than increasing productivity growth rates
to reduce poverty among young adults who have been left behind during recent decades
in terms of educational attainment. Furthermore our findings suggest policy makers
should consider policies aimed towards reducing inequalities between groups if

Introduction

In this article, I will introduce the concept of development-based investment strategy in order to understand the current situation of developing countries.

Developing countries are defined as those countries which have developed their own economies or industries through economic development programmes. The main objective of these programs is to develop them into productive units by means of an investment programme.

The IMF and the UNECOD are two major international organizations with different objectives. They work together to promote growth and prosperity in all areas of life.

The IMF and the UNECOD are both working towards creating more sustainable societies. The IMF works closely with the UNecod and the UNOCD because they believe that there is no need for any other organization to do so.

The UNecod is also working toward creating a more stable society where people can live independently from each other. The UNOCD is concerned about the stability of its members' lives.

The optimal control problem consists of three parts:
(1) the optimal control problem associated with the policy ;
(2) the policy solution which represents the desired outcome of the policy ;
(3) the policy parameter vector describing the expected output of the policy.
The optimal control problem is defined as follows:

3. Design the industrial policy.
4. Evaluate the results of the design process.","The development of a new policy for developing countries is a complex process

a) a policy-based approach, which is based on the assumption that the country
is growing at a rate proportional to its population; b) a policy-free
approach, which is based on the assumption that the country is growing at a
rate proportional to its population. Our policy-based approach is based on the
fact that the country is growing at a rate proportional to its population. It
also uses the fact that the country is growing at a rate proportional to its
population. This paper presents a novel approach to develop a policy for
developing countries. First, we introduce a set of policies that aim to

The approach is based on the concept of ""industrialization"" and the concept of ""development"". It is argued that the development of a country's industrial base can be achieved by means of a policy which is designed to promote the development of the country's industrial base. The paper also argues that the development of a country's industrial base can be achieved by means of a policy which is designed to promote the development of the country's industrial base. The paper concludes that the development of a country's industrial base can be achieved by means of a policy which is designed to promote the development of the country's industrial base.

econ,Inference on Functionals under First Order Degeneracy,"This paper presents a unified second order asymptotic framework for
conducting inference on parameters of the form $\phi(\theta_0)$, where
$\theta_0$ is unknown but can be estimated by $\hat\theta_n$, and $\phi$ is a
known map that admits null first order derivative at $\theta_0$. For a large
number of examples in the literature, the second order Delta method reveals a
nondegenerate weak limit for the plug-in estimator $\phi(\hat\theta_n)$. We
show, however, that the `standard' bootstrap is consistent if and only if the
second order derivative $\phi_{\theta_0}''=0$ under regularity conditions,
i.e., the standard bootstrap is inconsistent if $\phi_{\theta_0}''\neq 0$, and
provides degenerate limits unhelpful for inference otherwise. We thus identify
a source of bootstrap failures distinct from that in Fang and Santos (2018)
because the problem (of consistently bootstrapping a \textit{nondegenerate}
limit) persists even if $\phi$ is differentiable. We show that the correction
procedure in Babu (1984) can be extended to our general setup. Alternatively, a
modified bootstrap is proposed when the map is \textit{in addition} second
order nondifferentiable. Both are shown to provide local size control under
some conditions. As an illustration, we develop a test of common conditional
heteroskedastic (CH) features, a setting with both degeneracy and
nondifferentiability -- the latter is because the Jacobian matrix is degenerate
at zero and we allow the existence of multiple common CH features.","Inference on Functions Under Second-OrderDegeneracy

============

In this paper we are interested in the problem of inferring a functional $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ from a given set of data $\{\xi_1,\ldots,\xi_m\}$. For simplicity, we will assume that the data are realizations of random variables taking values in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Our goal is to find a function $f$ such that $$\label{","We consider the problem of inference for functional data models. We assume that a set
of functions is available, and we wish to estimate these functionals from noisy or
partial observations using only those observed values in some subset $S$ (called""training samples""). The goal here is not just estimation but also prediction: given an observation $\mathbf{x} \in S$, what are its neighbors? In this paper, our main contribution is two-fold: firstly by providing new results about how one can use information theoretic tools such as convex optimization techniques; secondly, through novel theoretical developments based upon recent work in machine learning theory, which show why it may be possible to learn good predictions even when there exist no training examples at hand. Our approach relies heavily on random matrix methods, including recently developed ones with applications beyond linear regression problems. To illustrate their usefulness, they have been applied successfully to various settings involving partial observability, e.g., time series forecasting, classification tasks, etc. However, most existing works do not take into account any prior knowledge regarding the underlying distribution of input variables nor does it make explicit assumptions concerning noise levels. This makes them unsuitable for many real world scenarios where both types of noises must necessarily coexist."
stat,A Bayesian Spatial Model for Imaging Genetics,"We develop a Bayesian bivariate spatial model for multivariate regression
analysis applicable to studies examining the influence of genetic variation on
brain structure. Our model is motivated by an imaging genetics study of the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), where the objective is to
examine the association between images of volumetric and cortical thickness
values summarizing the structure of the brain as measured by magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and a set of 486 SNPs from 33 Alzheimer's Disease (AD) candidate
genes obtained from 632 subjects. A bivariate spatial process model is
developed to accommodate the correlation structures typically seen in
structural brain imaging data. First, we allow for spatial correlation on a
graph structure in the imaging phenotypes obtained from a neighbourhood matrix
for measures on the same hemisphere of the brain. Second, we allow for
correlation in the same measures obtained from different hemispheres
(left/right) of the brain. We develop a mean-field variational Bayes algorithm
and a Gibbs sampling algorithm to fit the model. We also incorporate Bayesian
false discovery rate (FDR) procedures to select SNPs. We implement the
methodology in a new release of the R package bgsmtr. We show that the new
spatial model demonstrates superior performance over a standard model in our
application. Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from

The Bayesian Spatial model is a generalization of the Bayesian model, which was originally developed by [@Bertschinger]. It can be used to describe spatial patterns in biological data. The Bayesian model has been widely used in many fields of science and engineering research. However, it does not provide an accurate description of how genetic variation affects phenotypes or disease outcomes. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Spatial model that provides a more accurate description of genetics than the original Bayesian model.

The Bayesian Spatial model {#sec:bayesspatial}
==========================

In this section, we present the Bayesian Spatial model (BSM) proposed by [@DBLP:conf/sph/ChenZHN15] as well as its implementation in the SPSS package *Spatially-based* [@Kramer:book; @Liu:book].

The BSMM consists of two parts: a Bayesian model describing the distribution of genotype information and a spatial model describing the spatio-temporal patterning of genotype information. The Bayesian model describes both the distributions of genotype information and the spatial patterns of genotype information. The","The Bayesian spatial model for imaging genetics allows us to study genetic
variability through non-stationary distributions over discrete time scales.
This approach provides a framework for studying biological processes such as
genetic variation, gene expression, epigenetics, etc. This class of models
can be useful for understanding disease mechanisms and developing new treatments
for diseases caused by mutations.
In this paper, we use the Bayesian spatial model for imaging genetics to
study genes associated with cancer development. We consider two types of
models: (1) a Bayesian spatial model for genomics data; and (2) a Bayesian
spatial model for phenotypic data.
We demonstrate how the Bayesian spatial model can be used to understand genomic
variation under different conditions. We also discuss the advantages and
disadvantages of the Bayesian spatial model when compared to other spatially
differential models.
We illustrate the Bayesian spatial model's advantages and disadvantages
using the Bayesian spatial model for phenotype data.

estimates the spatial distribution of genetic variation in humans using a
spatiotemporal model that incorporates the spatial structure of the genome. Our
methods are applied to the study of the evolution of the human genome and the
evolutionary history of the human population. In addition, we apply our
approach to the study of the evolution of the human population and the
development of the human genome. Finally, we discuss how our methods can be used
to estimate the spatial distribution of genetic variation in humans. This

variation in humans and the evolution of the human population. These results
provide a novel framework for the study of the spatial distribution of genetic
variation in humans. Furthermore, they provide a new perspective on the
relationship between genetic variation and the evolution of the human population.","The goal of this paper is to develop a Bayesian spatial model for imaging genetics. The model is based on the idea that genetic variation can be represented by a spatial distribution of alleles, and that the spatial distribution of alleles can be estimated from the observed genotypes. The model is applied to the problem of estimating the spatial distribution of alleles in a population of individuals with known genotypes. The model is also used to estimate the spatial distribution of alleles in a population of individuals with unknown genotypes. The model is tested using simulated data sets. The results show that the model is able to accurately estimate the spatial distribution of alleles in both cases.

The Nash equilibria are defined as solutions to an optimization problem that minimizes expected squared error between observed and latent genotypes at each location in space (i.e., phenotype). We show how this framework can be used with existing spatial models such as those from machine learning or genetic epidemiology frameworks by using it within their priors. In particular we demonstrate its use through simulations where our proposed method outperforms competing methods when applied directly without prior knowledge about phenotypes. Our approach also allows us to incorporate covariates into these types of approaches while maintaining flexibility regarding what type(s) of data they take advantage of. Finally, since both simulated datasets contain missing values due to sampling errors, incorporating them may improve performance further. This work provides new insights into modeling image traits via deep neural networks; however more research needs to be done before widespread adoption becomes feasible.

stat,Approximation of the Cell Under Test in Sliding Window Detection Processes,"Analysis of sliding window detection detection processes requires careful
consideration of the cell under test, which is an amplitude squared measurement

the input signal is given by a sequence of discrete values of some parameters
such as the number of cells in the simulation box. This problem is often
described as a sliding window detection process because it involves moving
the windows along a path which includes all possible paths from one point
to another. The CEUT algorithm uses a two step procedure: First, the
input signals are sampled at random within the simulation box; second, the
output data are obtained through a series of steps such as sampling over
a grid of points. The CEUT algorithm requires no knowledge of the shape
of the potential well but only about how many cells there are in the
box. The CEUT algorithm does not require any knowledge of the size of the
box nor do it require any knowledge of the position of the wells. The CEUT
algorithm provides a means to estimate the area covered by the simulated
cells without knowing their location. The CEUT algorithm allows us to
simulate the behavior of the CEPT simulations when the input signal is
given by a sequence of discrete values of some unknown parameter vector.

method can be used for estimating the number of cells in the windows, and
provides a simple yet efficient estimation procedure. Our results show that
the estimated number of cells in the windows is close to the true number of
cells in the window. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
performance of our CUT estimator. Finally, we present experimental data

problems: one with respect to each neighbor's observations; another involving no
neighbors at all. Then by solving these problems simultaneously via convex optimization
methods or gradient descent methods, it turns out that both are equivalent when
both have closed form solutions. Theoretically speaking, they share similar optimal
regret properties. Numerical experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate good

The concept of fusion is a fundamental principle in computer science, and it has been used to describe the evolution of physical systems from one generation to another [@Kramer_book]. The idea was first introduced by Kramers and Schmitt, who proposed that an artificial neural network (ANN) could be built with a single neuron as its input for learning purposes [@kramer_ann]. In this paper, we will focus on the ANNs based on the so-called “classical” model [@schmitt_classical]. This classifier can be trained using a simple training procedure such as gradient descent or Bayesian inference methods [@bayes_learning].

The classical ANN consists of a set of neurons which are connected by synaptic connections between them. The output of each neuron is then fed into","The Monte Carlo fusion technique is a powerful tool for solving nonlinear
systems such as coupled differential equations. It allows one to study many
differential systems without having to resort to numerical methods. This
method provides efficient computations over a wide range of parameters while
being very fast and accurate.
In this paper, we use Monte Carlo fusion to investigate the effects of
multiple conservation laws and dissipational rates between two different
constraints: (1) the energy constraint; and (2) the momentum constraint.
We find that the energy constraints are necessary but not sufficient to ensure
the stability of the system under some conditions. The momentum condition
can be relaxed if there is no additional energy constraint imposed. The
energy constraint imposes only a small amount of energy at any given time
(typically less than $10^{-3}$ eV). The momentum constraint does not impose
any additional energy requirement when it is considered during the simulation.
The results obtained from the Monte Carlo fusion approach provide evidence
that the energy constraint plays a role in determining the stability of the
system.
This paper presents a new approach to studying the stability of a system based
on the energy constraint plus momentum balance problem. The main result

realistic data sets with a fixed number of observations and the other for
uniformly varying data sets. The results show that our approach is able to
improve the accuracy of the model predictions, but it is not as accurate as
other methods. In particular, we find that the MC algorithm can be used to
estimate the uncertainty in the prediction of the mean of the observed data
(i.e., the variance of the observed data). However, the MC algorithm is
computationally expensive and requires a high computational cost. Our
approach is also applicable to other problems such as the estimation of
parametric errors or the estimation of the covariance matrix of the data. It
is also applicable to other problems such as the estimation of the
correlation matrix of the data. Finally, we discuss how our proposed methodology

The Monte Carlo method is a powerful tool for simulating the fusion of
nuclei. The method is based on the idea that nuclei are composed of
nucleons, which are in turn composed of protons and neutrons. The
proton and neutron distributions are assumed to be Gaussian, with
mean values given by the known values of the proton and neutron
distributions. The nucleon distribution is then calculated from the
proton and neutron distributions using the Boltzmann equation.

The new approach is based on an iterative procedure that combines particle tracking with stochastic sampling to generate samples from different reaction mechanisms, and then uses these generated events as input in subsequent steps involving model calibration or parameter estimation. We demonstrate our methodology by simulating two types of nuclear fission: neutron capture (n-capture) and proton transfer ($\alpha$-$\alpha$). In both cases we find good agreement between results obtained using this technique compared to those provided by standard methods such as Geant4 simulations. Furthermore, it allows us to simulate more than one hundred species including isotopes up to $^{208}$Bi.

stat,Adaptive Quantile Low-Rank Matrix Factorization,"Low-rank matrix factorization (LRMF) has received much popularity owing to
its successful applications in both computer vision and data mining. By
assuming noise to come from a Gaussian, Laplace or mixture of Gaussian
distributions, significant efforts have been made on optimizing the (weighted)
$L_1$ or $L_2$-norm loss between an observed matrix and its bilinear
factorization. However, the type of noise distribution is generally unknown in
real applications and inappropriate assumptions will inevitably deteriorate the
behavior of LRMF. On the other hand, real data are often corrupted by skew
rather than symmetric noise. To tackle this problem, this paper presents a
novel LRMF model called AQ-LRMF by modeling noise with a mixture of asymmetric
Laplace distributions. An efficient algorithm based on the
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is also offered to estimate the
parameters involved in AQ-LRMF. The AQ-LRMF model possesses the advantage that
it can approximate noise well no matter whether the real noise is symmetric or
skew. The core idea of AQ-LRMF lies in solving a weighted $L_1$ problem with
weights being learned from data. The experiments conducted on synthetic and
real datasets show that AQ-LRMF outperforms several state-of-the-art
techniques. Furthermore, AQ-LRMF also has the superiority over the other
algorithms in terms of capturing local structural information contained in real
images.","The quantile low-rank matrix factorization (QLF) is a generalization of the classical QR factorization. The QLF can be used to compute the inverse rank of a matrix, and then use the result to compute the corresponding eigenvalues.

stat,Accelerated MM Algorithms for Ranking Scores Inference from Comparison Data,"In this paper, we study a popular method for inference of the Bradley-Terry
model parameters, namely the MM algorithm, for maximum likelihood estimation
and maximum a posteriori probability estimation. This class of models includes
the Bradley-Terry model of paired comparisons, the Rao-Kupper model of paired
comparisons allowing for tie outcomes, the Luce choice model, and the
Plackett-Luce ranking model. We establish tight characterizations of the
convergence rate for the MM algorithm, and show that it is essentially
equivalent to that of a gradient descent algorithm. For the maximum likelihood
estimation, the convergence is shown to be linear with the rate crucially
determined by the algebraic connectivity of the matrix of item pair
co-occurrences in observed comparison data. For the Bayesian inference, the
convergence rate is also shown to be linear, with the rate determined by a
parameter of the prior distribution in a way that can make the convergence
arbitrarily slow for small values of this parameter. We propose a simple
modification of the classical MM algorithm that avoids the observed slow
convergence issue and accelerates the convergence. The key component of the
accelerated MM algorithm is a parameter rescaling performed at each iteration
step that is carefully chosen based on theoretical analysis and
characterisation of the convergence rate.
Our experimental results, performed on both synthetic and real-world data,
demonstrate the identified slow convergence issue of the classic MM algorithm,
and show that significant efficiency gains can be obtained by our new proposed
method.","This paper presents a novel method for ranking scores in the context of classification. The algorithm is based on the use of a simple, yet powerful, algorithm for ranking score estimation.

Introduction
============

The human brain is composed of many layers of neurons that are organized into three main categories: primary visual cortex (PV), parietal cortex (PFC), and occipital cortex (OC). These layers form the basis of our understanding of how we perceive information [@bib-01]. PFC consists of two subcategories: the primary visual cortex (PV) and the parietal cortex (PFC). PV is comprised of the primary visual cortex (PV) and the parietal cortex (PFC). It contains both the primary visual cortex (PV) and the parietal cortex (PFC). The PFC is composed of the primary visual cortex (PV) and the parietal cortex (PFC). The PFC is composed of the primary visual cortex (PVC) and the parietal cortex (PFC). The PFC is composed of the primary visual cortex (PV","The accelerated MM algorithm is a new method which allows one to rank scores
from different data sets. This method uses a simple but powerful algorithm
to compute the score distribution over all possible pairs of points in a
given data set. It is based on the fact that each point in the dataset
has a probability density function (PDF) describing the distance between
the two points. The PDF describes the probability distributions of the
points within the given data set. The algorithm is implemented in MATLAB
using the `matrix` package.
In this paper, we use the `mmm_score` function to compute the score
distribution for a given data set. The algorithm is implemented in MATLAB
using the `matrix` package.
We apply the algorithm to a number of benchmark datasets including
data from the World Wide Web, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy,
etc.
###","The goal of this paper is to develop an accelerated version of the
matrix-matrix multiplication algorithm for ranking scores inference from
comparison data. The proposed algorithm is based on the idea of
accelerating the matrix-matrix multiplication algorithm by using
multiple iterations of the matrix-matrix multiplication algorithm.
The main idea is to use multiple iterations of the matrix-matrix
multiplication algorithm to accelerate the matrix-matrix multiplication
algorithm. The acceleration is achieved by using multiple iterations of the
matrix-matrix multiplication algorithm to compute the matrix-matrix
multiplications of the matrix A and the matrix B. The matrix-matrix
multiplications of the matrix A and the matrix B are computed using the
matrix-matrix multiplication algorithm. The matrix-matrix multiplication
algorithm is iteratively repeated until the matrix-matrix multiplication
algorithm converges. The convergence criterion is the relative change in the
matrix-matrix multiplication error. The matrix-matrix multiplication
algorithm is implemented using the Accelerated Matrix Multiplication
Algorithm (AMMA) [1].","We present a novel method to rank the scores of multiple ranking algorithms
using data from comparison data. We use this approach to generate rankings

many applications, including ranking of items in an online shopping cart or
ranking of products in a product catalog. It also can be applied to ranking
of items in a database. This paper presents two new approaches to ranking
scores: (1) using machine learning-based scoring functions to predict the
score of each ranking algorithm; and (2) using a combination of these methods to
determine the best ranking algorithm. These methods are compared to the
recommendations of several popular ranking algorithms. Finally, we discuss
the advantages and limitations of our proposed methodology. Overall, our
approach is a promising tool for ranking high quality items in a variety of
datasets. However, it is not without its drawbacks. First, it requires a large
amount of training data, which may limit its applicability.","

stat,Depth for curve data and applications,"John W. Tukey (1975) defined statistical data depth as a function that
determines centrality of an arbitrary point with respect to a data cloud or to
a probability measure. During the last decades, this seminal idea of data depth
evolved into a powerful tool proving to be useful in various fields of science.
Recently, extending the notion of data depth to the functional setting
attracted a lot of attention among theoretical and applied statisticians. We go
further and suggest a notion of data depth suitable for data represented as
curves, or trajectories, which is independent of the parametrization. We show
that our curve depth satisfies theoretical requirements of general depth
functions that are meaningful for trajectories. We apply our methodology to
diffusion tensor brain images and also to pattern recognition of hand written
digits and letters. Supplementary Materials are available online.","The [depth]{.smallcaps} algorithm also works well when there are multiple objects within a scene that have different properties.

depth function of the curve at each vertex. The depth function of the curve
is obtained by computing the depth function of the curve at each vertex and
then averaging them together. The average depth function is then used to
compute the depth function of the curve at each point of the curve. The
proposed depth function is shown to be more accurate than the depth function
of the curve itself. The accuracy of the proposed depth function is tested
using both synthetic and real data. The proposed depth function is compared
with the depth function of the curve itself and the depth function of the
curve points. The proposed depth function is also compared with the depth
function of the curve points themselves. The proposed depth function is found
to be superior to the other two approaches.","We present a novel method to compute the depth of curves in a graph. We
introduce an algorithm that can be used to compute the depth of a curve

depth of a curve. This weighted sum is computed by a function that is
constructed as a weighted sum of the depth of a curve. In this paper we
present a new approach to compute the depth of a curve in a graph. Our approach
is based on the notion of a weighted sum of the depth of a curve. It is
shown that the weighted sum of the depth of a curve is a weighted sum of the
width of a curve. Furthermore, it is shown that the weighted sum of the
deeper curves is a weighted sum of the width of a curve. Finally, we show that
the weighted sum of the depth of a curve is a weighted sum of the width of a

to graph theory. However, the weighted sum of the depth of a curve is not a

Bure-Wasserstein barycenters are widely used in many fields of science and engineering [@bw; @komatsu]. They are often used to measure the relative abundance of various species such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi or to determine the relative abundance of certain classes of molecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. They are also used to study the properties of fluids such as water vapor pressure, heat capacity, and so forth.

The most common type of barycenters consists of a set of two components: a barycentric component which is usually referred","The statistical inference problem involves finding solutions to some
statistical problems such as the barycenteristics problem. This approach
has many applications in machine learning, computer vision, statistics,
and other fields. It is often useful to find solution sets which are not
necessarily unique but may contain more than one set of points. For example,
the barycenters problem requires solving two different types of nonlinear
geometric systems: the Laplace-Beltrami system and the Dirichlet-Neumann
system. The former type uses only three independent variables; the latter
type employs all four independently chosen ones. The use of these forms of
theorems leads to new insights into how information is encoded in data.
In addition, it is possible to derive generalizations of the results from
these approaches. For example, if there are no known classes of discrete
data structures, e.g., continuous functions, they could be derived from
differentiable models based on their properties rather than just those given
by them.
For instance, the following class of distributions will allow us to obtain

the probability of false alarm can be produced, for a geometric mean detector,

full constant false alarm rate detector case, is then presented.","The Geometric mean constant is a measure that quantifies the degree of freedom in an experiment. The Geometric mean constant is defined as:

$$\label{eqn:geommean}
    \mu = \frac{1}{2}\left( 1 - \frac{1}{N_0^2} \right)$$

where $N_0$ is the number of photons emitted by the detector, $N_i$ is the number of photons detected by the detector and $N_i^2$ is the number of photons with energy greater than or equal to the threshold for detection. The Geometric mean constant is calculated using the following equation:

$$\label{eqn:geommean_constant}
    \mu = \frac{1}{2}\left( 1 - \frac{1}{N_0^2} \right)$$

where $N_0$ is the number of photons produced by the detector, $N_i$ is the number of photons detected by the detector and $N_i^2$ is the total number of photons measured at the detector. The Geometric mean constant is then given by:

$$","The Geometric mean constant false alarm probability (GEFAP) detector consists of a
single detector element which detects signals from two sources: a source at one
source and a signal from another source. GEFAP detectors are typically based on
the assumption that the signal intensity distribution follows a Gaussian
distribution over the area covered by the source. This assumption allows us to
use the GEFA detector to detect signals from multiple sources simultaneously.
This approach provides a simple and efficient way to estimate the GEFAP
detector's sensitivity without having to perform additional calculations.
In this paper, we extend the GEFA detector to multiple pulses. We use the
geometric mean field approximation to approximate the GEFA detector response
to multiple pulses. We demonstrate how our method can be used to estimate the
GEFAP detection sensitivity when multiple pulses are employed.
We also demonstrate how our method can be used to estimate the GEFAP
detection sensitivity when multiple pulses are not available.

detect a signal even when the false alarm rates of the pulses are very low.","Theoretically, we propose a new method for estimating the mean of an alarm
rate signal from multiple pulses. We show that this method is able to
identify the true alarm rate signal and can be used in combination with other

multiple pulse signals from different sources. It is shown that it can be
applied to both single-pulse and multi-pulse alarms. In addition, it is shown
that the proposed algorithm can be applied to multiple alarm signals from
different source. Finally, we apply our methodology to two real data sets: one
from Germany and another from Japan. Our results demonstrate that our method
can be applied to multiple alarm signals from different sources. This
approach is also applicable to multiple alarm signals from different sources.
We also show that our method can be applied to multiple alarm signals from
various sources. These results are consistent with previous work on the
mechanism of false alarm detection. However, they do not provide any
insight into the underlying mechanism of the false alarm detection. Therefore,

signals.","This paper presents a new method for the statistical inference of

probability distribution, and we present a new algorithm for the
estimation of the barycenter using this distance. We also discuss how
the estimation of the barycenter may be useful in other applications such
as the estimation of the mean of a distribution or the estimation of the

stat,An Automatic Interaction Detection Hybrid Model for Bankcard Response Classification,"In this paper, we propose a hybrid bankcard response model, which integrates
decision tree based chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) into
logistic regression. In the first stage of the hybrid model, CHAID analysis is
used to detect the possibly potential variable interactions. Then in the second
stage, these potential interactions are served as the additional input
variables in logistic regression. The motivation of the proposed hybrid model
is that adding variable interactions may improve the performance of logistic
regression. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid model, it
is evaluated on a real credit customer response data set. As the results
reveal, by identifying potential interactions among independent variables, the
proposed hybrid approach outperforms the logistic regression without searching
for interactions in terms of classification accuracy, the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)
statistics. Furthermore, CHAID analysis for interaction detection is much more
computationally efficient than the stepwise search mentioned above and some
identified interactions are shown to have statistically significant predictive
power on the target variable. Last but not least, the customer profile created
based on the CHAID tree provides a reasonable interpretation of the
interactions, which is the required by regulations of the credit industry.
Hence, this study provides an alternative for handling bankcard classification
tasks.","A novel approach to automatic inter-bank transaction detection.
[abstract_1]

Abstract: This paper presents a new automated inter-bank transaction detection hybrid model for bankcard response classification. The proposed model is based on the automatic interaction detection (AI) approach, which can be used to detect and classify transactions in real time. In addition, the proposed model also provides a novel method for automatic inter-bank transaction detection.

Introduction
============

In recent years, the number of banks has increased dramatically due to the increasing demand for financial services. As a result, many banks have adopted the automated inter-bank transaction detection (AI) approach as their main tool for banking transactions [@kim2016automatic]. However, it is difficult to distinguish between different types of transactions because they are not always correlated with each other. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new automated inter-bank transaction detection hybrid model that can differentiate between different types of transactions without using any correlation structure.

In this paper, we propose a novel automated inter-bank transaction detection hybrid model for bankcard response classification. The proposed model consists of two parts: a) a simple AI system; b) a hybrid AI model combining the two parts. The hybrid AI","The interplay between the two types of data processing systems are often very
difficult to separate from each other. This problem is particularly acute when
the system is coupled to a network of sensors. A hybrid model based on the
interaction detection approach proposed by the authors of this paper could
be useful for identifying potential problems related to the identification of
potential solutions to some existing problems.
In this paper, we propose a new hybrid model which combines the above
techniques together to provide a more flexible and efficient approach to
identifying potential solutions to many existing problems. The hybrid model
includes a set of discrete time independent variables describing the state of
each sensor node at any given time step. The nodes represent the states of
each sensor node according to a discrete time series representation. The
state space represents the information about the current state of each sensor
node. The output of the hybrid model is represented by a vector representing
the input signal associated with the corresponding sensor node. The resulting
vector contains all possible values of the inputs such that the average
value of the outputs obtained over the entire time interval is equal to zero.
The hybrid model allows us to identify differentiable functions of these
various parameters without having to resort to numerical","This paper presents a hybrid model for bank card response classification based on
the interaction between the bank card and the ATM. The hybrid model consists of
a set of two-layer neural networks which are trained separately from the
banker's response data. The bank cards are classified according to their
interaction with the ATM. The bankcards' interaction information is extracted
from the ATM's response data. The bankcard's interaction information is fed
into the bankcard's neural network layer where the bankcard's response class
is predicted. The bankcard's neural network output is compared against the
bankers' response class prediction. The bankcard's neural network outputs are
then combined together to predict the bank customers' response class. The
hybrid model is trained using the bank customer's response data and the ATM's
response data. The hybrid model is tested on the test data collected from
different banks. The hybrid model performs well on the test data.","Bankcard response classification (BRAC) is a widely used method to classify
individuals in financial transactions. However, it is difficult to identify
the correct answer based on the data collected from different banks. In this paper,
we propose an automatic interaction detection hybrid model that can be used to
identify the correct answers for BRAC. The proposed approach is based on two
different types of interactions: i) a single-pass interaction between bank
accounts and the corresponding transaction data; ii) a multi-pass interaction
between bank account and transaction data. We first show how to use these two
interactions to identify the correct answer for BRAC. Then we present our
proposed algorithm using both types of interactions. Our results demonstrate
that our proposed framework can be applied to various real-world applications
such as credit card processing, online banking, etc., and can also be used to
detect the incorrect answer for BRAC. Finally, we provide experimental
results on three benchmark datasets including US$1 billion ($0.921 USD), $2.5
trillion ($3.867 USD), and $4.7 trillion ($6.07 trillion).","
We present a new detector for multiple pulses, which is based on the
geometric mean constant false alarm rate detector (GMCFAR) and
extends it to multiple pulses. The detector is designed to be
capable of detecting multiple pulses with a high probability of
detection. The detector is based on the GMCFAR algorithm that
estimates the probability of false alarm as a function of the
number of pulses in a sequence. The detector is implemented using
the FAST algorithm. The detector is tested by applying it to
multiple pulses from a simulated signal. The results show that the
detector can detect multiple pulses with a high probability of
detection.
The detector is also used to test the performance of the GMCFAR
algorithm when applied to multiple pulses from a real signal. The
results show that the detector can detect multiple pulses with a
high probability of detection.

The proposed method is based on the combination of a deep learning-based approach and two different types of neural networks: one with convolutional layers, which can be used as feature extraction network; another that uses recurrent units (RNNs) in order to extract features from previous interactions between users' cards. In addition, we propose several modifications to improve performance by using preprocessing techniques such as data augmentation or training samples obtained through crowdsourcing services like Amazon Mechanical Turk. We evaluate our system against three state-of-the-art baselines including SOTA models trained via transferable artificial intelligence methods, namely BERT/BERT++ Transformer+Attention Network(BART), GPT3D CNN + RNNS & LSTMNet V2, C4CRFnet v1.0, DenseNets 1.5x10^6). Our results show significant improvement over all these baseline systems when compared to them both qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, they also demonstrate better generalization ability than other approaches tested during this study. Finally, it has been shown how incorporating some simple user feedback into classification process improves accuracy significantly."
stat,Normal Approximation and Confidence Region of Singular Subspaces,"This paper is on the normal approximation of singular subspaces when the
noise matrix has i.i.d. entries. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we
derive an explicit representation formula of the empirical spectral projectors.
The formula is neat and holds for deterministic matrix perturbations. Second,
we calculate the expected projection distance between the empirical singular
subspaces and true singular subspaces. Our method allows obtaining arbitrary
$k$-th order approximation of the expected projection distance. Third, we prove
the non-asymptotical normal approximation of the projection distance with
different levels of bias corrections. By the $\lceil \log(d_1+d_2)\rceil$-th
order bias corrections, the asymptotical normality holds under optimal
signal-to-noise ration (SNR) condition where $d_1$ and $d_2$ denote the matrix
sizes. In addition, it shows that higher order approximations are unnecessary
when $|d_1-d_2|=O((d_1+d_2)^{1/2})$. Finally, we provide comprehensive
simulation results to merit our theoretic discoveries.
Unlike the existing results, our approach is non-asymptotical and the
convergence rates are established. Our method allows the rank $r$ to diverge as
fast as $o((d_1+d_2)^{1/3})$. Moreover, our method requires no eigen-gap
condition (except the SNR) and no constraints between $d_1$ and $d_2$.","

(a) The system size $L$ is small enough so that no singularities are allowed;
(b) The number of eigenvalues of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is bounded from below by some
constant constant independent of $L$.
In addition, there exists a unique solution $(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n)$ of the
system problem such that $$\label{eq:norm}
\|\mathbf{A}\cdot \mathbf{B}\|_{L^2(\Omega)}=0$$ where $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are given matrices whose entries are positive definite functions of their arguments.
This condition implies that if one takes any nonnegative real numbers satisfying these conditions, then it is possible to find solutions which satisfy the above assumption.
However, when solving the system, i.e., finding all zero vectors at each point, one may not always obtain those values corresponding to points outside the domain. This leads to problems like convergence issues due to large numerical errors.
To overcome these problems, we propose a new method called Normal App","The normal approximation is a method which approximates a function f(x) at x
by a linear combination of basis functions s(x). The basis functions are chosen
to be orthonormal eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator. The norm of the
approximated function is given by the sum of the norms of the basis functions.
The normal approximation is widely used in numerical analysis because it
provides a good compromise between accuracy and computational cost. It is
also useful in the context of singular perturbation theory where the exact
function is known only up to a certain order. This paper presents a new
approach to the normal approximation based on the use of confidence regions.
The approach is based on the idea that the approximate function may be
approximated by a linear combination of basis functions whose norm is bounded
by a certain constant. The bounding constant is chosen so that the error
between the approximate function and the exact function is bounded by a
certain number. The proposed confidence region is based on the concept of
the confidence interval. The main advantage of the proposed confidence
region is that it provides a simple and efficient way to compute the
confidence level.","We propose a novel approach to normal approximation of singular subspace
functions. We show that the proposed method is robust against the presence of

subspaces. Our results show that the proposed method is robust against the
existence of a singularity in the space, and that it can be used for the
estimating of the norm of a singular subspace in an arbitrary number of

We show how this can be achieved using singular value decomposition (SVD) on subspace matrices, which are constructed from orthogonal projections onto low-dimensional spaces such as eigenspaces or reproducing kernels Hilbert space representations for example. The resulting approximation errors converge uniformly at least polynomially fast towards their true values when applied to functions defined over these approximating sets; we also provide conditions under which they may not even have finite second moments. This result holds regardless whether one uses SVDs only to construct matrix norms or instead applies them directly to function evaluations: it does so both if all entries of each column sum up to 1 and otherwise. In particular cases where no explicit norm exists but there exist positive definite symmetric bilinear forms satisfying certain properties, our results imply convergence rates matching those obtained via standard methods based on convex optimization algorithms like proximal point interpolation.

stat,Kernel Density Estimation Bias under Minimal Assumptions,"Kernel Density Estimation is a very popular technique of approximating a
density function from samples. The accuracy is generally well-understood and
depends, roughly speaking, on the kernel decay and local smoothness of the true
density. However concrete statements in the literature are often invoked in
very specific settings (simplified or overly conservative assumptions) or miss
important but subtle points (e.g. it is common to heuristically apply Taylor's
expansion globally without referring to compactness). The contribution of this
paper is twofold (a) we demonstrate that, when the bandwidth is an arbitrary
invertible matrix going to zero, it is necessary to keep a certain balance
between the \emph{kernel decay} and \emph{magnitudes of bandwidth eigenvalues};
in fact, without the sufficient decay the estimates may not be even bounded (b)
we give a rigorous derivation of bounds with explicit constants for the bias,
under possibly minimal assumptions. This connects the kernel decay, bandwidth
norm, bandwidth determinant and density smoothness. It has been folklore that
the issue with Taylor's formula can be fixed with more complicated assumptions
on the density (for example p. 95 of ""Kernel Smoothing"" by Wand and Jones); we
show that this is actually not necessary and can be handled by the kernel decay
alone.","The kernel density estimator is a non-parametric estimator of the density in terms of its parameters. The kernel density estimate is defined as:

where $x^*$ is the parameter vector and $\hat{\rho}_{k}$ is the estimated density at time $k$.

However, the accuracy of the KDE method depends heavily on the choice of the
kernel function. In this paper, we consider the case where the kernel function
is a Gaussian kernel. We assume that the kernel function is known exactly and
that the data are i.i.d. Gaussian random variables. We derive the bias of the
KDE estimator when the kernel function is chosen to be a Gaussian kernel.
We prove that the bias is minimized when the kernel function is chosen to be
a Gaussian kernel with a bandwidth equal to the inverse of the variance of
the data. This result is based on the fact that the variance of the KDE
estimator is proportional to the square root of the variance of the data.","We propose a kernel density estimation bias estimator that is based on the

function from noisy observations. We consider two types of kernels: Gaussian and

have enough smoothness properties with respect to each other. In particular, for
Gaussian densities this is equivalent to assuming either bounded support or an
appropriate concentration function. For Laplacian ones it requires some kind of
regularity assumption such as $L^2$-bounded derivatives. This leads us to propose""minimally regularized estimators""for KDEs based only on these assumptions.

stat,Modelling the clustering of extreme events for short-term risk assessment,"Having reliable estimates of the occurrence rates of extreme events is highly
important for insurance companies, government agencies and the general public.
The rarity of an extreme event is typically expressed through its return
period, i.e., the expected waiting time between events of the observed size if
the extreme events of the processes are independent and identically
distributed. A major limitation with this measure is when an unexpectedly high
number of events occur within the next few months immediately after a
\textit{T} year event, with \textit{T} large. Such events undermine the trust
in the quality of these risk estimates. The clustering of apparently
independent extreme events can occur as a result of local non-stationarity of
the process, which can be explained by covariates or random effects. We show
how accounting for these covariates and random effects provides more accurate
estimates of return levels and aids short-term risk assessment through the use
of a new risk measure, which provides evidence of risk which is complementary
to the return period.","The clustering of extreme events is a key component in the risk assessment process. The clustering algorithm is designed to identify and classify these events, which are then used to estimate the probability that an event will occur. This approach has been shown to be effective in identifying high-risk events (e.g., those with high levels of exposure to asbestos) but does not provide any information about how many times each event occurred.

(2) [**Affective Event Detection: A new tool for risk assessment**]{}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most commonly used tool for detecting adverse events in epidemiological studies is the Event Detecting Toolkit (EDT). It is based on the concept of “event detection” where it is applied to detect potential adverse events by analyzing the occurrence of specific events within a population or group of individuals. In this paper, we present a novel tool called *EventDetect* that uses the same concept as EDT but allows for more flexible analysis of individual events rather than using a single method.

The main idea of EventDetect is to use a set of data points from a large number of samples collected over a period of time to determine whether there is a change in the distribution of such events across the population","The clustering of extreme events may be defined as the number of events
that are clustered together at any given time. This definition allows us to
assume that each event is associated with a cluster which is independent of
the other clusters. The clustering algorithm is based on the following
formulae:

to infrastructure. These events are often associated with a high risk of
collapse. The clustering of extreme events may be due to the presence of
extreme events themselves or due to the presence of other extreme events.
This paper presents a methodology for modelling the clustering of extreme
events based on the concept of extreme event clusters. The methodology is
based on the idea that extreme events are likely to cluster together because
they are likely to occur close together in space and time. The methodology
is tested on two extreme event clustering scenarios: (i) the case of a
single extreme event occurring at a specific location and time; and (ii) the
case of a single extreme event occurring at a specific location and time but
with a random spatial distribution. The methodology is validated through
simulation studies and compared against a number of existing methods.","The study aims to understand how the distribution of extreme event data
changes over time. We use a Bayesian framework to model the clustering of
extreme events in a long-run risk assessment dataset, and we show that the
distribution of extreme events is highly correlated with the distribution of
the underlying data. The results suggest that the clustering of extreme events
is driven by the distribution of the underlying data. This suggests that the
clustering of extreme events is driven by the distribution of the underlying
data. Our analysis shows that the clustering of extreme events is driven by the
distribution of the underlying data. In addition, our findings indicate that
there are significant differences between the distributions of extreme events
and the underlying data. These findings suggest that the clustering of extreme
events is driven by the distribution of the underlying data. However, the
results of this study do not support the hypothesis that the clustering of
event data is driven by the distribution of the underlying data. Instead, the
findings suggest that the clustering of event data is driven by the distribution
of the underlying data. Therefore, the clustering of event data is driven by the

statistics. It is the difference between the estimated density and the true
density, which is often referred to as the ""kernel"". The bias can be caused by
the choice of the bandwidth or the kernel function used for the estimation.
This paper presents a new bias estimator that is based on the idea of
""minimizing the bias with respect to the bandwidth"". This approach has been
used successfully in many applications such as image processing, image
analysis, and image registration. In this paper, we propose a new bias
estimate using the minimization of the bias with respect to the kernel width.
We show that the proposed estimator is unbiased when the kernel width is
small enough. We also present a theoretical analysis of the bias estimate.
Finally, we apply the proposed estimator to the problem of estimating the
kernel density from a set of images.Q:

In this paper, we propose an approach to model clusterings in time series data based on multivariate autoregressive models (MVARs). The proposed method can be applied both as unsupervised learning or supervised machine learning methods depending upon whether it uses only one variable at each step during training or multiple variables simultaneously through cross validation. We apply our methodology using daily weather datasets from Brazil between 2010 and 2019 with different levels of complexity: simple linear regression; nonlinear mixed effects modelling including random forest algorithm; Bayesian additive logistic regressions incorporating Gaussian processes prior distributional assumptions; deep neural network classifiers trained by gradient descent optimisation algorithms that are able to deal with complex spatio-temporal patterns such as clusters. Our results show good performance compared against other state-of-the-art approaches when tested under various scenarios involving high dimensional input space. Moreover, they demonstrate how MVAR could provide useful information about future climate change projections even if these predictions do not take into account past environmental conditions.

It also shows potential applications beyond just predicting severe climatic extremes but may have important implications for policy making related to adaptation measures."
stat,Inference for spherical location under high concentration,"Motivated by the fact that circular or spherical data are often much
concentrated around a location $\pmb\theta$, we consider inference about
$\pmb\theta$ under ""high concentration"" asymptotic scenarios for which the
probability of any fixed spherical cap centered at $\pmb\theta$ converges to
one as the sample size $n$ diverges to infinity. Rather than restricting to
Fisher-von Mises-Langevin distributions, we consider a much broader,
semiparametric, class of rotationally symmetric distributions indexed by the
location parameter $\pmb\theta$, a scalar concentration parameter $\kappa$ and
a functional nuisance $f$. We determine the class of distributions for which
high concentration is obtained as $\kappa$ diverges to infinity. For such
distributions, we then consider inference (point estimation, confidence zone
estimation, hypothesis testing) on $\pmb\theta$ in asymptotic scenarios where
$\kappa_n$ diverges to infinity at an arbitrary rate with the sample size $n$.
Our asymptotic investigation reveals that, interestingly, optimal inference
procedures on $\pmb\theta$ show consistency rates that depend on $f$. Using
asymptotics ""à la Le Cam"", we show that the spherical mean is, at any $f$, a
parametrically super-efficient estimator of $\pmb\theta$ and that the Watson
and Wald tests for $\mathcal{H}_0:{\pmb\theta}={\pmb\theta}_0$ enjoy similar,
non-standard, optimality properties. We illustrate our results through
simulations and treat a real data example. On a technical point of view, our
asymptotic derivations require challenging expansions of rotationally symmetric
functionals for large arguments of $f$.","Inference for the position of a spherical object in space.

Introduction
============

The concept of “spherical location” is one that has been used to describe objects with different properties, such as shapes and sizes [@Bertin]. The idea was first introduced by Bertin [@bettin], who proposed an analogy between two points on a sphere (a point at infinity) and its corresponding surface area $S$. In this way, he showed how it can be shown that if we have three spheres $\mathbb{S}_1$, $\mathbb{S}_2$ and $\mathbb{S}_3$, then $$\label{eq:s-sphere-area}
  S = \frac{1}{2}\left(x^2 + y^2 - x^2y + y^2z\right)$$ where $x=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ and $y=\sqrt{x^2+z^2}$. This formula holds also when considering surfaces which are not necessarily flat or non-flat but rather curved.

It is well known that there is no simple relationship","The application of the TDSR method to two-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger
(NLS) and the Allen-Cahn equations provides a new approach to inferring
the distribution of particles from their position at different locations
in space. This technique allows us to study particle distributions over large
spherical regions without having to resort to numerical methods.
This extension of the TDSR method makes it possible to obtain information
about spatial positions of many particles simultaneously through Monte Carlo
methods.
We demonstrate how the TDSR method can be used to estimate the density profile
of a random walker when there are many particles moving in parallel along
a path which includes both stationary and fluctuating paths.
Using the TDSR method, we find that the probability mass function of a
random walker depends only on the number of particles within each step.
This result suggests that the TDSR method can be used to determine whether
a given trajectory should be considered as being more likely than another one
to move away from some point.

statistical mechanics. It describes the motion of a particle in a potential
field which is not homogeneous but rather depends on the position of the
particle. The problem is often formulated as a nonlinear partial differential
equation (PDE) involving the Laplace-Beltrami operator. The solution of the
problem is usually obtained by numerical methods such as Runge-Kutta,
implicit-explicit, etc. For example, the classical Euler method is based on
the implicit-explicit scheme. The Euler method is a very popular method due
to its simplicity and efficiency. However, it is known that the Euler method
is not stable when the particle moves near the surface of a sphere.
Therefore, the Euler method is not suitable for solving the spherical
location problem. In this paper, we introduce a new method based on the
spherical gradient descent method. The spherical gradient descent method is
a new method proposed by us recently [1]. The spherical gradient descent
method is a new method developed for solving the spherical location problem
with high concentration. The spherical gradient descent method is based on

spherical coordinate system. We use this method to estimate the location of
a sphere in a spherical coordinate system. The method is based on the
convexity of the spherical coordinates and the fact that the spherical
coordinates are convex. In particular, we show that the convexity of the
skeleton of a sphere is equivalent to the convexity of its surface. This
mechanism is used to estimate the location of a sphere in a spherical
coordinate system. Our results show that the convexity of the surface of a
cylinder is equivalent to the convexity of its surface. Furthermore, we
show that the convexity of the surface of a cylinder is equivalent to the
convexity of its surface. Finally, we show that the convexity of the surface
of a cylindrical cylinder is equivalent to the convexity of its surface.
Our results show that the convexity of the surface of a cylindrical cylinder
is equivalent to the convexity of its surface. These results are consistent
with the convexity of the surface of a cylinder.","Modelling the clustering of extreme events for short-term risk assessment

[","We consider the problem of estimating a point in space from noisy measurements. We
consider two types of measurement noise: (i) Gaussian and non-Gaussian, which are
both common to many applications; and (ii), we also allow additive white Gaussian
noise with unknown variance $\sigma^2$. In this paper, our main goal is to study how
to estimate an arbitrary number $k$ points using these data sets when both type 1
and 2 noises have been considered separately. To do so, firstly, by assuming that
the underlying distribution belongs to some class ${\cal C}$, i.e., it has finite
support, one can show asymptotic normality results on estimation error based only
on random matrix theory. Secondly, motivated by recent developments related to low
rank matrices arising naturally in machine learning problems such as deep neural
networks or tensor decompositions, another approach consists in exploiting rank
reduction techniques. This leads us to propose new estimators called reduced basis
estimators whose construction relies heavily on singular value analysis. The key
feature of them lies in their ability to deal simultaneously with different kinds
of errors while being computationally efficient at each step."
stat,Anomaly Detection in Networks with Application to Financial Transaction Networks,"This paper is motivated by the task of detecting anomalies in networks of
financial transactions, with accounts as nodes and a directed weighted edge
between two nodes denoting a money transfer. The weight of the edge is the
transaction amount. Examples of anomalies in networks include long paths of
large transaction amounts, rings of large payments, and cliques of accounts.
There are many methods available which detect such specific structures in
networks. Here we introduce a method which is able to detect previously
unspecified anomalies in networks. The method is based on a combination of
features from network comparison and spectral analysis as well as local
statistics, yielding 140 main features. We then use a simple feature sum
method, as well as a random forest method, in order to classify nodes as normal
or anomalous. We test the method first on synthetic networks which we
generated, and second on a set of synthetic networks which were generated
without the methods team having access to the ground truth. The first set of
synthetic networks was split in a training set of 70 percent of the networks,
and a test set of 30 percent of the networks. The resulting classifier was then
applied to the second set of synthetic networks. We compare our method with
Oddball, a widely used method for anomaly detection in networks, as well as to
random classification. While Oddball outperforms random classification, both
our feature sum method and our random forest method outperform Oddball. On the
test set, the random forest outperforms feature sum, whereas on the second
synthetic data set, initially feature sum tends to pick up more anomalies than
random forest, with this behaviour reversing for lower-scoring anomalies. In
all cases, the top 2 percent of flagged anomalies contained on average over 90
percent of the planted anomalies.","A network is a collection of nodes that are connected by an edge. The edges between nodes can be represented as a set of nodes, each node representing a transaction or a financial transaction. A transaction represents the amount of money involved in the transaction. For example, if a bank has $100,000 in its account, and it has $10,000 in its account balance, then the transaction will have a value of $10,000.

particles which are coupled together via a common source term. This type of
network may consist of many nodes connected by a common source term such as
a network of links between nodes. A network consisting of many nodes will often
be referred to as a network of links. The link length distribution function
(LDF) over all possible links from one node to another is called the link
distribution function (LDF). The LDFs represent the probability density functions
of the number of links connecting two nodes at any given time. The LDFs were
first proposed by Gao and Wang in 1995; they use the following definition:
$$\label{eqn:ldf}

The proposed approach is based on the use of a set of anomaly detection algorithms which are designed to detect anomalies in the network structure. The proposed approach uses the network topology information to identify the anomalies and then uses these anomalies to infer the network structure. The proposed approach is tested on two real-world financial transaction networks: one is a stock market network and the other is a credit card network. The results show that the proposed approach can successfully detect the anomalies in the network structures.,"We present a novel approach for anomaly detection in networks with application to financial
transactions. We use the network structure of an existing credit card system as a case
study, and propose two new algorithms that can be used to detect anomalies in
network structures. The first algorithm detects anomalies in the network
structure by using a combination of both machine learning techniques and deep
learning methods. In addition, we show how the second algorithm can be applied to
existing systems. Our results demonstrate that our proposed method is
comparable to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we provide a
description of the advantages and limitations of each algorithm. Finally, we
present some future work on this problem. This paper is a contribution to the field
by providing a comprehensive overview of the current research in this area. It
provides a general framework for anomaly detection in networks with application to
financial transactions. A key feature of this work is the identification of
anomalies in the network structure. To this end, we propose three different
algorithms: (1) Deep Neural Network Classification; (2) Machine Learning Algorithm
and Designing Model Based On Feature Extraction from Data Using Convolutionary or

We show how this approach allows us to detect anomalous behavior even when we do not know what it means; e. g., if our data set contains only one node labeled A but has multiple nodes containing labels B, C, D etc.; then any sample drawn at some point during training will contain both types of abnormalities: either those corresponding to label Xs or Ys. Our methodology also provides new insights into existing methods used to analyze financial transaction datasets such as LSTMs-based models trained over time windows where they perform well while failing badly under other conditions.

stat,Can You Trust This Prediction? Auditing Pointwise Reliability After Learning,"To use machine learning in high stakes applications (e.g. medicine), we need
tools for building confidence in the system and evaluating whether it is
reliable. Methods to improve model reliability often require new learning
algorithms (e.g. using Bayesian inference to obtain uncertainty estimates). An
alternative is to audit a model after it is trained. In this paper, we describe
resampling uncertainty estimation (RUE), an algorithm to audit the pointwise
reliability of predictions. Intuitively, RUE estimates the amount that a
prediction would change if the model had been fit on different training data.
The algorithm uses the gradient and Hessian of the model's loss function to
create an ensemble of predictions. Experimentally, we show that RUE more
effectively detects inaccurate predictions than existing tools for auditing
reliability subsequent to training. We also show that RUE can create predictive
distributions that are competitive with state-of-the-art methods like Monte
Carlo dropout, probabilistic backpropagation, and deep ensembles, but does not
depend on specific algorithms at train-time like these methods do.","The following is a list of the most important points in the

prediction given prior knowledge about the underlying problem. For example,
the prediction error may not be accurate enough when there are many unknown
parameters involved in the process; however, if one knows all parameters at
least once, it is possible to predict correctly even though some assumptions
may be wrong.
In this paper, we use the TDSR method to estimate the posterior predictive
error after learning from data. We find that the posterior predictive error
of the TDSR method is approximately 0.5% lower than the corresponding
posterior predictive error obtained by the conventional method.
We also demonstrate that the TDSR method provides better results than the
conventional method when the number of unknown parameters is large.
This result indicates that the TDSR method can be used to estimate the
prior predictive error without any additional assumptions.

stat,Neural Clustering Processes,"Probabilistic clustering models (or equivalently, mixture models) are basic
building blocks in countless statistical models and involve latent random
variables over discrete spaces. For these models, posterior inference methods
can be inaccurate and/or very slow. In this work we introduce deep network
architectures trained with labeled samples from any generative model of
clustered datasets. At test time, the networks generate approximate posterior
samples of cluster labels for any new dataset of arbitrary size. We develop two
complementary approaches to this task, requiring either O(N) or O(K) network
forward passes per dataset, where N is the dataset size and K the number of
clusters. Unlike previous approaches, our methods sample the labels of all the
data points from a well-defined posterior, and can learn nonparametric Bayesian
posteriors since they do not limit the number of mixture components. As a
scientific application, we present a novel approach to neural spike sorting for
high-density multielectrode arrays.","The neural network is a computer program that processes data from the brain. The neural network can be used to process information in various ways, including:

1.  A neural network consists of a set of neurons and their connections with other neurons. The neuron's connection strength determines how much weight it has to give to each input node.

2.  An input-output relationship between two or more inputs may be represented by a neural network.

3.  Each output node receives an input signal representing one or more values for its input nodes.

4.  If there are multiple outputs connected to any given input node, then they all receive different weights.

5.  When no such relationships exist between these three inputs, the resulting neural network will have zero net weight.

6.  If some combination of both sets of networks produces exactly the same result, then this operation will produce only slightly different results.

the brain. They typically consist of two components: a neural network which
sees out from each other through connections between neurons and their associated
neurons, and a non-neural component which encodes information about these networks
through hidden layers. Neural clustering models were originally developed at
a very early stage of development but now become increasingly popular over the
next few years. This approach allows one to build up a neural network structure
from scratch without having to learn how it works. The neural network consists
of a set of nodes connected by weights whose inputs are coupled via synaptic
weights. The output layer contains all possible combinations of input neuron
weights and outputs neuronal weights. The resulting neural network is called a

neural clusters formed by randomly selecting among them a set of features
which represent specific aspects of the environment around the cluster.

behaviors of random processes are related to each other. This allows us to
explore the relationship between these two phenomena through their effects on
the probability distribution function of events. The causal calculus formalism
provides a framework for understanding the nature of causality in stochastic
systems such as biological systems. It is well known that there is no simple
formula for describing the behavior of any system under consideration.
However, it is possible to derive some useful properties of certain types of
causation models from them. For example, one can consider the following
model:
1.  A random variable $X$ is assumed to be independent of $Y$ iff $\langle X,Y\rangle =0$.
2.  If $X$ is not identically distributed over all real numbers, i.e., $$\label{eqn:x}
    \Pr(X=y)=\frac{\sum_{k=1}^m Y_k}{\sum_{k=1}^m Y_k},$$ where $Y_j$ denotes the joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$,","The causal calculus provides a framework for modeling causal relationships between
events. The causal calculus allows for the modeling of causal relationships
between events based on the assumption that the underlying causal structure is
consistent with the observed data. The causal calculus models the causal
relationship between two events through the introduction of a set of
parameters called the causal parameters. The causal parameters are defined such
that they represent the causal structure consistent with the observed data.
In this paper, we introduce a new causal calculus which includes the causal
parameters as a part of the causal parameters. The causal calculus is shown to
be equivalent to the standard causal calculus when the causal parameters are
defined such that they represent the causal structure consistent with the
observed data. The causal calculus is extended to include the causal parameters
in the causal parameters. The causal calculus is further extended to include
the causal parameters in the causal parameters. The causal calculus is shown to
be equivalent to the standard causal calculus when the causal parameters are
defined such that they represent the causal structure consistent with the
observed data. The causal calculus is extended to include the causal parameters
in the causal parameters. The causal calculus is compared to the standard causal
calculus and the causal parameters in","We study causal inference in a linear model with a fixed number of
covariates. We show that the presence of a covariate can lead to a
significant bias in the estimation of the causal effect. In contrast, the
absence of a covariate does not necessarily imply a significant bias. The
causality effect is estimated by a linear regression model with a fixed
number of covariates. Our results suggest that the presence of a covariate
can lead to a significant bias in the estimation of the causal effect. This
result is consistent with the results of previous studies on causal inference
in the absence of a covariate. However, we find that the presence of a
corresponding covariate does not necessarily imply a significant bias. For
example, the presence of a covariate does not necessarily imply a significant
bias. Finally, we show that the presence of a covariate does not necessarily
induce a significant bias. These findings are consistent with the results of
recent studies on causal inference in the presence of a covariate. They also
provide evidence for the existence of a causal mechanism that leads to a
significantly biased estimation of the causal effect.","Neural Clustering Processes

[","We study causal inference problems with latent confounder variables. We show that a
generalization to linear regression models is possible for such data when we use an
alternative formulation based on conditional expectation (CE). This allows us to
derive new consistency results under which our estimators are consistent even if
the number $n$ of observations grows at most as $\sqrt{T}$, where $T$ denotes the
total time horizon over all units involved in any treatment assignment process. In
particular cases this result can be used directly without further assumptions or
proofs: it implies strong convergence rates up to logarithmic factors; its proof
is elementary but requires some technical tools from convex analysis; finally, by
using recent advances in machine learning techniques one may obtain faster rate
guarantees than those given here. Our main contribution consists in showing how
to extend these theoretical findings to more general settings involving cycles
and selection bias. The latter case corresponds to situations where there exist
multiple treatments available during each period/cycle while only two periods
are observed per cycle. For instance, consider binary choice experiments where
treatment effects occur after random sampling into groups according to their own
choice behavior."
stat,Cost-sensitive Selection of Variables by Ensemble of Model Sequences,"Many applications require the collection of data on different variables or
measurements over many system performance metrics. We term those broadly as
measures or variables. Often data collection along each measure incurs a cost,
thus it is desirable to consider the cost of measures in modeling. This is a
fairly new class of problems in the area of cost-sensitive learning. A few
attempts have been made to incorporate costs in combining and selecting
measures. However, existing studies either do not strictly enforce a budget
constraint, or are not the `most' cost effective. With a focus on
classification problem, we propose a computationally efficient approach that
could find a near optimal model under a given budget by exploring the most
`promising' part of the solution space. Instead of outputting a single model,
we produce a model schedule -- a list of models, sorted by model costs and
expected predictive accuracy. This could be used to choose the model with the
best predictive accuracy under a given budget, or to trade off between the
budget and the predictive accuracy. Experiments on some benchmark datasets show
that our approach compares favorably to competing methods.","This paper is a continuation of the work of [@BH] and [@CK].

Introduction
============

The problem of selecting parameters for a model sequence $\mathcal{M}$ has been studied in many papers. In this paper, we study the problem of choosing parameters for a model sequence $\mathcal{M}$ with $n$ variables (i.e., models) that are selected from an ensemble of sequences $\mathcal{M}_1,\ldots, \mathcal{M}_n$. The parameter selection process can be described as follows. First, each variable $x_{i+1}$ is chosen independently at random from all possible models; then, given some set of values $\mathcal{A}$, one chooses its value according to the following rule: $$\label{eq:choicerule}
    x_{i+1} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n y_j$$ where $y_j$ is the probability distribution over the number of different models $(x_i)_{i=1}^n$ which have exactly $k$ distinct values. The choice rule depends on the particular choice of","The cost-sensitive selection algorithm is based on the fact that each
sequence of variables may contain many different types of parameters which
may not be known at all. This means that if one sequence contains more than
one parameter, it will always contain some type of unknown variable whose
value depends on only one particular parameter. This property allows us to
design a cost-sensitive selection algorithm for any sequence of models having
many possible parameters.
In this paper, we consider the following two classes of sequences:
(a) sequences with no constraints; and (b) sequences with non-constrained
constraints.
We define the cost-sensitive selection problem under the assumption that there
are no constraints between the input sequence and the output sequence.
We prove that the cost-sensitive selection algorithm is equivalent to the
generalized least squares (GLS) algorithm when the number of inputs are large.
We further show that the GLS algorithm is computationally efficient when the
number of outputs is small.
We apply the GLS algorithm to the following three examples:
(a) the KdV sequence consisting of $n=2$ vertices and $n=3$ edges;
(b) the NLS sequence","The cost sensitive selection of variables (CSSV) method is a method for
selecting a set of variables from a set of candidate variables based on the
cost function associated with the selected variables. The method is widely
used in machine learning applications such as classification problems.
However, the method does not consider the uncertainty of the selected
variables. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to the CSSV method which
includes the uncertainty of the selected variables. The method is called
Ensemble of Model Sequences (EMS). The proposed EMS method is based on the
ensemble of model sequences generated by the ensemble of models algorithm.
The proposed method is tested on two benchmark problems: 1) the linearized
Korteweg-de Vries equation and 2) the nonlinear Schrödinger equation.","We study the problem of selecting a model sequence by ensemble of
sequential models. We show that the ensemble of models is equivalent to the
estimation of the model sequence by an ensemble of models. The resulting
algorithm is computationally efficient and can be used for the estimation of
the model sequence. In addition, we provide a simple algorithm for the
selection of the model sequence by ensemble of models. Our results show that
there are many advantages of ensemble of models over the existing methods. For
example, the ensemble of models can be used to select the model sequence by
ensembling the model sequences of the ensemble of models. This is especially
useful in the case where the model sequence is a mixture of two or more
variables. Furthermore, the ensemble of models can be used to select the
model sequence by ensemble of models. Finally, we show that the ensemble of
models can be used to select the model sequence by ensemble of models. These
results are useful for the estimation of the model sequence by ensemble of
 Models. However, the method of ensemble of models is not optimal in the
case where the model sequence is a mixture of two or more variables. Therefore,
we propose a new method for the selection","The paper presents a new approach to causal inference that is based on the idea of latent confounds. The approach is motivated by the fact that causal inference is often performed in the presence of cycles (i.e., when the causal model is not fully specified).

machine learning models. The proposed approach is based on the concept that, if
the model sequence contains only one variable at each iteration step (i.e., it
is cost-sensitive), then this single selected variable can be used to select all
others as well. We show how such an idea leads naturally from Bayesian inference
to selection algorithms with respect to ensembles of random forests or other deep
learning methods. Our main contribution is twofold: we first provide theoretical
guarantees regarding convergence rates under our framework; second, using these
results, we develop efficient implementations which are guaranteed not to diverge
even when applied directly to large datasets containing millions of observations.
Our implementation achieves competitive performance compared against state-of-the-art
methods while being computationally cheap enough to run even after hundreds of
thousands of iterations. In addition, since they do not require any prior knowledge
about data distribution nor about number of clusters within them, their runtime
can scale linearly with dataset size without sacrificing accuracy."

significance in the development of competitive analysis as a performance

performance of Graham's online \textit{list scheduling algorithm(LSA)} for
independent jobs. In the literature, \textit{LSA} has already been proved to be

upper bounds on the competitive ratio of $2-\frac{2}{m}$ and

Introduction
============

The theory of programming has been around for some time now in many different forms. It was first introduced by John Searle in his book *Programming* in the early 1960’s (see [@Searle]). It became popularized by the work of David Brouwer in his book *Programming*. It also appeared in the book “Programming” in the early 1970’s.

In this paper we will focus on the theory of programming as it relates to its application to learning machines. We will use the term computer science because there is no such thing as an academic discipline today. The main goal of this paper is to provide a brief history of the theory of programming which can be found in the book *Programming* by David Brouwer.

The theory of programming {#sec:theory}
=========================

The theory of programming","The learning process involves solving a set of linear differential equations
using a learning machine. This approach allows us to learn more about the
nature of the problem at hand than would be possible without any prior knowledge
of the underlying system. The learning process consists of two steps:
(1) Initialisation of the learning machine; (2) Learning over the training
machine.
In the first step, the learning machine is initialized with a set of data
sets which are generated randomly from a training set. The next step is
to generate new data sets based on the learned data. The learning algorithm
then proceeds through the following steps:
(1) Generate a new set of data points.
(2) Compute the gradient of the objective function.
(3) Calculate the error term.
(4) Solve the resulting optimization problem.
(5) Update the learning machine.
(6) Repeat the above steps until convergence.
This procedure is repeated until convergence.
The learning process is iterated until convergence.
The learning machine is trained again until convergence.
The learning process is repeated until convergence.
The learning machine is trained once every 5 times.
The learning process is repeated until convergence.
The","This paper presents a learning machine approach to the problem of learning
from data. The approach is based on the idea that there are two types of
learning machines: (i) learning machines that learn from examples, and (ii)
learning machines that learn from rules. The former type of learning machine
is called a rule learning machine, and the latter type of learning machine is
called a learning algorithm. The learning algorithms are designed to learn
from examples, while the rule learning machines are designed to learn from
rules. The learning process is divided into three stages: (i) learning from
examples, (ii) learning from rules, and (iii) learning from both examples and
rules. The learning processes are implemented using a combination of genetic
algorithms and neural networks. The learning models are evaluated using
experimental data sets obtained from a real-world application. The results
show that the proposed learning models are able to learn from both examples
and rules, and outperform the existing learning models.","We propose a novel learning algorithm for the classification of social
norms. We show that it is possible to learn a set of rules that are optimal
for a given set of social norms. The algorithm is based on an iterative
learning procedure that is inspired by the classical gradient descent method
and is applied to various problems in machine learning. Our approach is
based on the fact that the optimal rule is a function of the number of
social norms. In particular, we show that the optimal rule can be obtained
from a set of rules that are optimal for a given set of social norms. This
result is useful for the design of algorithms for social norm classification.
The algorithm is also applied to the problem of learning a classifier for
classifying social norms. It is shown that the optimal rule is a function of
the number of social norms. Finally, we present a general framework for
optimising the classification of social norms. For the case of a single social
norm, our algorithm is able to learn a set of rules that are optimal for a
given set of social norms. Furthermore, we show that the optimal rule is a
function of the number of social norms.","

with its environment. We show how to optimise such policies using reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithms in order to learn them automatically without any human-
supervision or supervision on their performance. The learned rules are then used
to train agents with different levels of expertise who can be trained via RL as
well. Our results demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that our approach
can outperform previous approaches when applied directly at training time but is
also able to generalize well beyond this setting if we apply it after having
trained some initial models. In particular, applying these methods before fine-tuning
the model improves accuracy compared to simply rerunning pre-training steps. This
is because they allow us to use information about what has been learnt during
previous iterations which allows better adaptation towards new tasks even though
they do not require additional data points. Furthermore, once adapted into more
generalised environments where there may have previously only involved one task,
our method performs similarly to supervised transfer across multiple domains. To
show the effectiveness of each component within RLAO, experiments were conducted
using three real world datasets including two public ones collected through crowds
ourcing platforms."
cs,Computational model discovery with reinforcement learning,"The motivation of this study is to leverage recent breakthroughs in
artificial intelligence research to unlock novel solutions to important
scientific problems encountered in computational science. To address the human
intelligence limitations in discovering reduced-order models, we propose to
supplement human thinking with artificial intelligence. Our three-pronged
strategy consists of learning (i) models expressed in analytical form, (ii)
which are evaluated a posteriori, and iii) using exclusively integral
quantities from the reference solution as prior knowledge. In point (i), we
pursue interpretable models expressed symbolically as opposed to black-box
neural networks, the latter only being used during learning to efficiently
parameterize the large search space of possible models. In point (ii), learned
models are dynamically evaluated a posteriori in the computational solver
instead of based on a priori information from preprocessed high-fidelity data,
thereby accounting for the specificity of the solver at hand such as its
numerics. Finally in point (iii), the exploration of new models is solely
guided by predefined integral quantities, e.g., averaged quantities of
engineering interest in Reynolds-averaged or large-eddy simulations (LES). We
use a coupled deep reinforcement learning framework and computational solver to
concurrently achieve these objectives. The combination of reinforcement
learning with objectives (i), (ii) and (iii) differentiate our work from
previous modeling attempts based on machine learning. In this report, we
provide a high-level description of the model discovery framework with
reinforcement learning. The method is detailed for the application of
discovering missing terms in differential equations. An elementary
instantiation of the method is described that discovers missing terms in the
Burgers' equation."," This paper presents a novel method for the prediction of neural networks. The proposed approach is based on the fact that, in order to predict an action from its state space, it needs to learn how many actions are possible and then use this information to predict the next action. In this work, we propose a novel method for predicting neurons using deep neural network (DNN) models. We first show that DNN models can be trained with simple training data and then apply the learned weights to the input layer of the DNN model. Then, we present a novel method for predicting neuron representations by applying a deep neural network (DNN) model to the input layer of the DNN model. Finally, we show that our method can be applied to other tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, and speech recognition.

(i) A simulation study of the system under study; and (ii) a test case analysis
of the proposed method. Simulation studies are performed over a wide range of
time scales, including real-time, dynamic, stochastic, and non-dynamic
scenarios. For each simulation step, the results are compared against known
results from previous simulations. This comparison is done at different
timescales, such as when the system is initially initialized but not yet
reinitialized. The resulting data sets are then used to build a new set of
simulations which represent the actual behavior of the system. These models
are then tested across all possible time scales.
In addition to these three steps, the computational model discovery process
includes a number of additional steps. First, the simulation environment is
created based on the existing data sets. Second, the network topology is
generated based on the existing data sets. Third, the network topology is
generated via a series of Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, the network
topology is generated via a series of Monte Carlo simulations.

This paper presents a new approach to the problem of learning from
learning machines. The approach is based on the idea that the
learning machine can be seen as a social norm. This allows us to
explore the nature of the learning process in a more general way than
has been possible before. We show how the learning machine can be
interpreted as a rule-based system which can be optimised using
rules. We also show how the learning machine can be seen as a
social norm by showing how the learning machine can be seen as a

cs,Differentially Private M-band Wavelet-Based Mechanisms in Machine Learning Environments,"In the post-industrial world, data science and analytics have gained
paramount importance regarding digital data privacy. Improper methods of
establishing privacy for accessible datasets can compromise large amounts of
user data even if the adversary has a small amount of preliminary knowledge of
a user. Many researchers have been developing high-level privacy-preserving
mechanisms that also retain the statistical integrity of the data to apply to
machine learning. Recent developments of differential privacy, such as the
Laplace and Privelet mechanisms, drastically decrease the probability that an
adversary can distinguish the elements in a data set and thus extract user
information. In this paper, we develop three privacy-preserving mechanisms with
the discrete M-band wavelet transform that embed noise into data. The first two
methods (LS and LS+) add noise through a Laplace-Sigmoid distribution that
multiplies Laplace-distributed values with the sigmoid function, and the third
method utilizes pseudo-quantum steganography to embed noise into the data. We
then show that our mechanisms successfully retain both differential privacy and
learnability through statistical analysis in various machine learning
environments.","The proposed wavelet-based machine learning (WML) framework is a novel approach to model the human voice using a single neural network.

In recent years, many researchers have developed new methods to analyze and understand the acoustic properties of natural sounds. These include the artificial neural network (ANN), which uses an artificial neural network to classify sound samples into classes based on their acoustic properties [@kim2016], and the deep neural network (DNN), which uses a deep neural network to classify all possible classes with high accuracy [@liu2017deep]. In addition, the deep neural network has been widely used to process music by analyzing its structure or composition through several techniques [@zhang2018dnn; @zhao2019deep; @xiao2018deep; @yang2018deep; @wang2015deep; @bao2018deep; @feng2014deep; @hong2018deep; @yuan2018deep; @yu2020deep; @shen2020","The discrete-time wavelet-based machine learning (DLM) model is one of the most
important models in machine learning research. It consists of a set of
regularized linear operators which are defined over a domain $X$ and whose
properties are determined by the data points at each point in $X$. The
data sets are represented by a set of matrices $A$, where $A$ is given by
the eigenvalues of the corresponding matrix elements. The regularized
operators are constructed from these basis functions by solving certain
eigenvalue problems. The resulting system of ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) is solved by means of a series of iterative least squares techniques.
The DML model is implemented in MATLAB.

flow through a network of nodes. This simulation study uses the
following two types of networks: (1) a single node network consisting of
nodes connected by links; and (2) a multi-node network consisting of many
nodes connected by links. The main goal of this paper is to provide a
computational framework for the DML model without introducing any additional
techniques","Machine learning algorithms are becoming increasingly popular in various

cs,Tensor-Tensor Products for Optimal Representation and Compression,"In this era of big data, data analytics and machine learning, it is
imperative to find ways to compress large data sets such that intrinsic
features necessary for subsequent analysis are not lost. The traditional
workhorse for data dimensionality reduction and feature extraction has been the
matrix SVD, which presupposes that the data has been arranged in matrix format.
Our main goal in this study is to show that high-dimensional data sets are more
compressible when treated as tensors (aka multiway arrays) and compressed via
tensor-SVDs under the tensor-tensor product structures in (Kilmer and Martin,
2011; Kernfeld et al., 2015). We begin by proving Eckart Young optimality
results for families of tensor-SVDs under two different truncation strategies.
As such optimality properties can be proven in both matrix and tensor-based
algebras, a fundamental question arises: does the tensor construct subsume the
matrix construct in terms of representation efficiency? The answer is yes, as
shown when we prove that a tensor-tensor representation of an equal dimensional
spanning space can be superior to its matrix counterpart. We then investigate
how the compressed representation provided by the truncated tensor-SVD is
related both theoretically and in compression performance to its closest
tensor-based analogue, truncated HOSVD (De Lathauwer et al., 2000; De Lathauwer
and Vandewalle, 2004), thereby showing the potential advantages of our
tensor-based algorithms. Finally, we propose new tensor truncated SVD variants,
namely multi-way tensor SVDs, provide further approximated representation
efficiency and discuss under which conditions they are considered optimal. We
conclude with a numerical study demonstrating the utility of the theory.","This paper is a continuation of the work of [@BH] on the representation of tensor products.

Differential privacy [@Dwork2006] is a technique that aims at protecting sensitive data against possible manipulation by an adversary. The goal is to","We study the problem of representing a tensor as an inner product between two
tensors. We show that this representation can be efficiently computed by using
the singular value decomposition (SVD) on both factors, which is known to have
good compression properties in practice. However we also prove its optimality: it
is optimal when considering only one factor at any time; i.e., if $f$ has rank 1
and $\mathbf{x} \in {\mathbb R}^n$, then there exists some matrix ${\mathbf M}_f$
such that $${\mathbf x} = f(\mathbf{M}_f)$$ Moreover our result shows how SVDs are used to
compute representations with good performance even though they do not preserve
information about each component separately. In particular, while previous work
has focused primarily on optimizing over all components simultaneously or just
one part per dimension, here information from multiple dimensions is preserved
by computing products involving different parts of the same vector. This allows
us to compute compressed versions of matrices without having access to their
original full size. Our results demonstrate why such methods may outperform other
methods based solely on minimizing loss functions."
cs,Coalition-Safe Equilibria with Virtual Payoffs,"Consider a set of parties invited to execute a protocol $\Pi$. The protocol
will incur some cost to run while in the end (or at regular intervals), it will
populate and update local tables that assign (virtual) rewards to participants.
Each participant aspires to offset the costs of participation by these virtual
payoffs that are provided in the course of the protocol. In this setting, we
introduce and study a notion of coalition-safe equilibrium. In particular, we
consider a strategic coalition of participants that is centrally coordinated
and potentially deviates from $\Pi$ with the objective to increase its utility
with respect to the view of {\em at least one} of the other participants. The
protocol $\Pi$ is called a coalition-safe equilibrium with virtual payoffs
(EVP) if no such protocol deviation exists. We apply our notion to study
incentives in blockchain protocols. We proceed to use our framework to provide
a unified picture of incentives in the Bitcoin blockchain, for absolute and
relative rewards based utility functions, as well as prove novel results
regarding incentives of the Fruitchain blockchain protocol [PODC 2017] showing
that the equilibrium condition holds for collusions up to $n-1$ players for
absolute rewards based utility functions and less than $n/2$ for relative
rewards based utility functions, with the latter result holding for any ""weakly
fair"" blockchain protocol, a new property that we introduce and may be of
independent interest.","The Coaltation of the Earth and Space: A Review

problem models for solving nonlinear systems of differential equations. It
has many applications in engineering, biology, economics, finance, and
other areas. Coalition-safe equilibrium problems are often solved by means
of numerical methods such as Runge-Kutta methods. These methods allow us
to approximate solutions based on known properties of the system at hand.
The Coalition-safe equilibrium approach allows us to obtain exact solutions
for arbitrary functions of variables which are not necessarily unique. This
allows us to find optimal values for some unknown functionals of variable
values. The Coalition-safe equilibrium solution may be obtained from any
method available today.

of the NLS equation. The Coalition-safe equilibrium solver is designed
to provide efficient approximations to the original NLS equation when it

the field of game theory. It is defined as the problem of finding a set of
players who are all willing to play against each other but not to form any
coalition. The problem is often formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear
optimization problem where the players' payoffs are given by a vector of
coefficients. The problem is usually solved by using linear programming techniques
to find the best coalition formation. However, the problem is NP-hard even if
the payoffs are linear functions. In this paper, we consider the coalitional
game formulation of the problem which allows the payoffs to be nonlinear. We
introduce a new algorithm for solving the problem based on the idea of virtual
payoffs. The algorithm is based on the concept of coalitional equilibrium and
allows the payoffs to be nonlinear. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to
the optimal coalition formation.","We study the coexistence of two competing models for the coexistence of
two different types of equilibrium states. We show that the model with a
cooperative equilibrium state is more stable than the model with an
incompetent equilibrium state, and that the coexistence of two different
equilibrium states can be described by a single equilibrium state. The
comparison between these two models shows that they are both consistent
with each other. In particular, we find that the coexistence of two
different equilibrium states is not inconsistent with each other. This
measure of coexistence is important in the context of the problem of
quantum computation. Our results suggest that the coexistence of two
conventional equilibrium states may be explained by a combination of
interactions between the two models. However, we do not know whether the
combination of the two models is sufficient to explain the coexistence of
the two equilibrium states. To address this issue, we propose a new
approach to the coexistence of two equilibrium states. Specifically, we
propose a novel model that combines the two models and predicts the coexistence
of two equilibrium states.","Tensor-Tensor Products for Optimal Representation and Compression

payoff profiles and the payoffs are determined by a coalition of players. We
consider two types of virtual payoff functions: (i) those that depend on an agent's
coalitional profile, i.e., they model how each individual is affected when all
others receive different amounts; and (ii) ones where only some individuals'
cooperations affect their utilities -- e.g., if one player has higher utility than
another then her cooperation will increase his welfare. In both cases we show
that there exist equilibria such as Nash or Pareto optimal solutions for any set
of initial conditions. Moreover, our results imply new characterizations of these

proposed by several authors. However, there is a lack of research on how to
design and implement such an approach. In this paper we present MIRvehicles as a

first prototype with two different types of sensors, namely accelerometer and
measuring device. Then we design a novel sensor based on these two types of
devices. The proposed system can be used to measure the acceleration of a car

in terms of accuracy, precision, and computational efficiency. Our results show
that MIR vehicular systems are able to achieve high accuracy, precision, and
computational efficiency compared to existing methods. This work provides a new
approach that could help the development of future autonomous vehicle

Introduction
============

Coalitions are a fundamental concept in game theory. They are the basic building blocks of all games, and they can be used to model many different types of interactions between players. In this paper, we study coalitions that are safe for virtual payoffs.

A coalition is *safe* for virtual payoffs if it is possible to reach a Nash equilibrium without violating any of the constraints imposed by the virtual payoff function.

In this paper, we consider coalitions that are safe for virtual payoffs when the virtual payoff function is a linear combination of the payoffs of the players. We show that this is the case for coalitions that are safe for virtual payoffs under the assumption that the players’ payoffs are independent and identically distributed (","The development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is a promising research area. The use case can be broadened to include many different applications, such as monitoring and surveillance systems in urban areas or even more complex scenarios like traffic control at intersections with pedestrians crossing the roadways. However, current AV platforms are mainly focused on either single tasks that require high computational power or multiple task combinations where they cannot scale up efficiently due to their limited computing resources. In this work we present MIR-Vehicle -- an open source platform developed by our group which combines both hardware acceleration techniques based upon deep learning models combined with software libraries dedicated towards real time vehicle behavior analysis using OpenCV's Python API. We have implemented several algorithms from various domains including image processing/computer vision, reinforcementlearning, machine learning etc., together with some novel ones specifically designed for driving behaviors prediction within 3D environments. Our codebase has been released under Apache 2 license allowing anyone interested in developing similar tools to benefit directly from it without needing any prior knowledge about its underlying technology. This paper provides details regarding how these components were integrated into one unified framework called mirvehicle.org along with detailed information related to each component used during testing phases."
cs,Simultaneous Identification of Tweet Purpose and Position,"Tweet classification has attracted considerable attention recently. Most of
the existing work on tweet classification focuses on topic classification,
which classifies tweets into several predefined categories, and sentiment
classification, which classifies tweets into positive, negative and neutral.
Since tweets are different from conventional text in that they generally are of
limited length and contain informal, irregular or new words, so it is difficult
to determine user intention to publish a tweet and user attitude towards
certain topic. In this paper, we aim to simultaneously classify tweet purpose,
i.e., the intention for user to publish a tweet, and position, i.e.,
supporting, opposing or being neutral to a given topic. By transforming this
problem to a multi-label classification problem, a multi-label classification
method with post-processing is proposed. Experiments on real-world data sets
demonstrate the effectiveness of this method and the results outperform the
individual classification methods.","The Twitter user's Twitter account is the primary means of identifying a Tweet. The user can also use the Twitter API to identify the Tweet.

(1) The Twitter User's Twitter Account:

(a) A Twitter user who has an account on Twitter can create a tweet using the Twitter API.

(b) An account that has an account on Twitter can create a tweet using the Twitter API.

(c) An account that has an account on Twitter can create a tweet using the Twitter API.

(d) An account that has an account on Twitter can create a tweet using the Twitter API.

(e) An account that has an account on Twitter can create a tweet using the Twitter API.

(f) An account that has an account on Twitter can create a tweet using the Twitter API.

(g) An account that has an account on Twitter can create a tweet using the Twitter API.

(h) An account that has an account on Twitter can create a tweet using the Twitter API.

(i) An account that has an account on Twitter can create a tweet using the Twitter API.

(j) An account that has an account on Twitter can create a tweet","The tweet purpose function is defined as follows:
$$\begin{aligned}
f(x) &=& \frac{1}{2}\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)\end{aligned}$$
where $x$ is the position vector at time $t$. The tweet purpose function
can be expressed as $$\begin{aligned}
f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} f_k(x+k).\end{aligned}$$
In this paper, we will use the following notation:
$$\begin{aligned}
f_n(x) &=& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x+y)dy \\
f_m(x) &=& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x+m)dy\\
f_n(x) &=& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x+n)dy\end{aligned}$$
where $f_n(x)$ is the distribution function of $x$ over the interval $[-\infty,-\","The purpose of a tweet is to communicate information about a specific topic.
The position of a tweet is determined by the user's intention to share it.
In this paper, we propose a new approach to identify the tweets' purposes and
positions based on the user's intention to share them. We use the Twitter
statistical features to extract the user's intention to share his/her tweets.
We then use these features to identify the tweets' positions. We compare the
results obtained from the proposed approach with those obtained from the
traditional approaches.","We present a novel method for simultaneous identification of tweet purpose and
position. We propose an algorithm that can be used to identify tweets with
similar content, and we show how it is possible to simultaneously identify
tweets with similar content. The proposed approach is based on the concept of
the Twitter keyword space, which is a collection of words that are related to
each other by a common keyword. In this paper, we first show that our
algorithm can be applied to both the text-based and the tweet-based keyword
space. Then, we apply the algorithm to two different datasets: one from the US
and another from China. Our results show that our algorithm can be used to
identify tweets with similar content, and we show that it can be used to
successfully identify tweets with similar content in both datasets. Finally, we
show that our algorithm can be used to identify tweets with similar content
in Chinese, while it can be used to identify tweets with similar content in
US. This work is the second contribution of this research. It is also the first
work to use the same algorithms to identify tweets with similar content in both
datasets.","MIR-Vehicle: Cost-Effective Research Platform for Autonomous Vehicle Applications

social media. However, it remains unclear how to identify tweets with different
tweet purposes (e.g., news reporting or opinion sharing) from Twitter data. In this
paper we propose an approach for identifying tweet positions based on their purpose
and position information extracted by using text-based sentiment analysis methods.
We also develop two novel algorithms: one uses word embedding as input features;
the other applies self attention mechanism to extract relevant words' semantic
information. We evaluate our proposed method against several baselines including BERT

being performed during each time step. Our results show significant improvement over
baseline models when compared across various datasets such as NewsQA dataset, CiteSeerX

of both approaches under varying conditions like number of training samples per
task type, length distribution among all classes/subclasses within same class, size
of vocabulary between train & test sets."
cs,On the Resilience of Deep Learning for Reduced-voltage FPGAs,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are inherently computation-intensive and also
power-hungry. Hardware accelerators such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays
(FPGAs) are a promising solution that can satisfy these requirements for both
embedded and High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. In FPGAs, as well as
CPUs and GPUs, aggressive voltage scaling below the nominal level is an
effective technique for power dissipation minimization. Unfortunately, bit-flip
faults start to appear as the voltage is scaled down closer to the transistor
threshold due to timing issues, thus creating a resilience issue.
This paper experimentally evaluates the resilience of the training phase of
DNNs in the presence of voltage underscaling related faults of FPGAs,
especially in on-chip memories. Toward this goal, we have experimentally
evaluated the resilience of LeNet-5 and also a specially designed network for
CIFAR-10 dataset with different activation functions of Rectified Linear Unit
(Relu) and Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh). We have found that modern FPGAs are
robust enough in extremely low-voltage levels and that low-voltage related
faults can be automatically masked within the training iterations, so there is
no need for costly software- or hardware-oriented fault mitigation techniques
like ECC. Approximately 10% more training iterations are needed to fill the gap
in the accuracy. This observation is the result of the relatively low rate of
undervolting faults, i.e., <0.1\%, measured on real FPGA fabrics. We have also
increased the fault rate significantly for the LeNet-5 network by randomly
generated fault injection campaigns and observed that the training accuracy
starts to degrade. When the fault rate increases, the network with Tanh
activation function outperforms the one with Relu in terms of accuracy, e.g.,
when the fault rate is 30% the accuracy difference is 4.92%.","

[Abstract]","The deep learning approach developed by Srivastava and colleagues
has recently been extended to the problem of reduced-voltage
fPGA systems. This extension allows us to apply the TDSR method to
the problem of reducing voltage fPGA systems. The main advantage of the
TDSR method is that it does not require any additional knowledge about the
system's structure but only provides a means to compute solutions from data
that are known at each time step. The TDSR method is particularly useful
for solving problems where there is no prior knowledge about the system's
structure.
In this paper, we extend the TDSR method to tackle these problems without
any prior knowledge about the system's structure. We use the TDSR method to
simplify the solution space of the original problem under consideration.
We find that the TDSR method gives rise to a new class of models which
are able to approximate the original problem when given sufficient information
about the system's structure.
This result suggests that the TDSR method can be used to efficiently solve
a wide range of nonlinear differential equations including those arising due
to the presence of noise.

introduction of a new design change due to the introduction of a new

(i) a new designer is introduced; and (ii) a new designer is removed from the
dataset. The results show that the proposed architecture is resilient to the
introduction of a new designer.","We present a novel approach to reduce the voltage of an analog FPUA by
using deep learning. We show that this method can be used in both low and high
power applications, such as video conferencing or real time data analysis. In
both cases, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve a reduction in the
current consumption of the system by using a single-stage neural network. The
method is also applicable to other types of FPUAs, including those with
low power consumption. Our results show that the proposed technique can be
used in many different scenarios, including low power applications, where the
system is not limited to a particular application. This paper presents a new
approach to reducing the current consumption of a FPUA by using deep learning.
The proposed algorithm is based on two main steps: (1) training a model for
the current consumption of the system; (2) training a model for the current
consumption of the system; and (3) training a model for the current consumption
of the system. These steps are implemented in Python code. A simulation study
shows that our approach can significantly improve the performance of existing
flux control systems.","The purpose of this paper is to identify the tweet's position in the Twitter stream. The position can be used as a proxy for the user's location, which is important for the purpose of location-based services such as Google Maps.

methods on these tasks on a variety of evaluation metrics. We also show that it

than the pointwise ranking loss, which suggests that incorporating relative
positions of two or more sentences in the loss function contributes to better
learning.","This paper is a continuation of the work of [@DBLP:conf/cvpr/KumarVZ16] and [@ChenLiu:2018]. The authors present a novel method for ranking sentences in a deep learning setting.

to learn an attention mechanism between each layer and its preceding one in such
a way as not only capturing local dependencies but also taking into account global
dependencies across all previous levels. We show empirically on several tasks
that DARR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while being computationally
efficient at training time compared with existing methods based solely on word2vec

Background
Sentence classification has been studied extensively in recent years. The most popular methods include bagging, boosting, random forests, etc. However, these methods have their own limitations. For example, bagging requires a large number of training data, which is not always available. Boosting requires a large amount of training data, which","We propose a novel HMM framework to query multiple frames of an image sequence. The proposed method is based on the idea that, given any set $S$ containing all possible images in some fixed order and their corresponding time series embeddings $\mathbf{x}_s$, we can find out which one among them has been previously seen by our system (i.e., it was not yet part of its training data). We show how this approach allows us to efficiently identify new candidates from old ones without having access to additional information about those already present or absent. Our experiments demonstrate significant gains over state-of-the-art methods when applied directly with existing datasets: they are able to retrieve more than 50% better results compared against previous approaches while using only 1/3 as much memory per candidate; even if these improvements come at considerable computational cost. Furthermore, thanks to being agnostic towards different types of queries such as temporal patterns, spatial relations between consecutive views etc., no prior knowledge regarding what type of object should be searched upon needs to be assumed during learning process nor does need arise after completion of task execution."
cs,Towards Improving the Performance of the RNN-based Inversion Model in Output Tracking Control,"With the advantages of high modeling accuracy and large bandwidth, recurrent
neural network (RNN) based inversion model control has been proposed for output
tracking. However, some issues still need to be addressed when using the
RNN-based inversion model. First, with limited number of parameters in RNN, it
cannot model the low-frequency dynamics accurately, thus an extra linear model
has been used, which can become an interference for tracking control at high
frequencies. Moreover, the control speed and the RNN modeling accuracy cannot
be improved simultaneously as the control sampling speed is restricted by the
length of the RNN training set. Therefore, this article focuses on addressing
these limitations of RNN-based inversion model control. Specifically, a novel
modeling method is proposed to incorporate the linear model in a way that it
does not affect the existing high-frequency control performance achieved by

Introduction {#sec:intro}
============

Video search has become an important research topic in recent years due to its wide applications in various fields such as video surveillance, video retrieval, and video summarization. Video search systems usually use a large amount of video data to perform video search. However, the size of the video data is usually limited by the bandwidth of the network or storage capacity of the server. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a video search system that can efficiently process videos with limited","Output tracking control (OTC) is a promising approach to improve vehicle safety. A key challenge for OTC systems, however, lies in accurately inferring and predicting future states from past observations without any additional information or assumptions on system dynamics models such as neural networks. This paper proposes an improved model that can be trained with only limited training data by using recurrently connected residual network layers which are known to have superior performance compared to traditional deep learning architectures when applied directly into supervised tasks like classification problems. The proposed method uses two differentiable convolutional autoencoders based upon attention mechanism combined with self-attention module within each layer. We show through extensive experiments conducted over various datasets including real world driving scenarios how our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods while being more efficient than previous approaches at inference time. Our code will soon become available online: this https URL. To facilitate reproducibility we provide all necessary preprocessing steps along with detailed analysis results obtained during testing phase. Furthermore, since it has been shown previously that incorporating external knowledge about environment provides better prediction accuracy then simply adding new features, e.g., weather conditions, one could also use these extra inputs instead of just relying solely on internal representations learned via encoder/decoder architecture."
cs,Learning and Evaluating Contextual Embedding of Source Code,"Recent research has achieved impressive results on understanding and
improving source code by building up on machine-learning techniques developed
for natural languages. A significant advancement in natural-language
understanding has come with the development of pre-trained contextual
embeddings, such as BERT, which can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks with
less labeled data and training budget, while achieving better accuracies.
However, there is no attempt yet to obtain a high-quality contextual embedding
of source code, and to evaluate it on multiple program-understanding tasks
simultaneously; that is the gap that this paper aims to mitigate. Specifically,
first, we curate a massive, deduplicated corpus of 7.4M Python files from
GitHub, which we use to pre-train CuBERT, an open-sourced code-understanding
BERT model; and, second, we create an open-sourced benchmark that comprises
five classification tasks and one program-repair task, akin to
code-understanding tasks proposed in the literature before. We fine-tune CuBERT
on our benchmark tasks, and compare the resulting models to different variants
of Word2Vec token embeddings, BiLSTM and Transformer models, as well as
published state-of-the-art models, showing that CuBERT outperforms them all,
even with shorter training, and with fewer labeled examples. Future work on
source-code embedding can benefit from reusing our benchmark, and from
comparing against CuBERT models as a strong baseline.","This is a tutorial on how to use the source code of an application.

economics, and physics. The Monte Carlo techniques are based on the idea of
approximating the value of a random variable by a random variable whose
distribution is known. The most common approach is to use a random variable

differences between the values of two random variables. This approximation
is valid when the distributions of the two random variables are known. We

This paper presents a new approach to the problem of visual evaluation of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for time series data. The approach is based on the idea of using a GAN to generate a synthetic time series, and then evaluating the generated time series against a set of time series that are known to be generated by the same GAN. The approach is evaluated in two ways: 1) by comparing the generated time series with the known time series; and 2) by comparing the generated time series with the known time series after applying a preprocessing step which removes the effects of the GAN. The results show that the approach can produce good results when compared with the known time series.

cs,Nested Column Generation decomposition for solving the Routing and Spectrum Allocation problem in Elastic Optical Networks,"With the continued growth of Internet traffic, and the scarcity of the
optical spectrum, there is a continuous need to optimize the usage of this
resource. In the process of provisioning elastic optical networks using the
flexible frequency grid paradigm, telecommunication operators must deal with a
combinatorial optimization problem that is NP-complete namely the Routing and
Spectrum Allocation(RSA) problem. Following on our previous study, where we
used Integer Linear Programming, and proposed a Column Generation algorithm
based on a Lightpath decomposition, which proved to be the most efficient so
far, we now consider the traditional Configuration decomposition that has been
studied in other works in the past. In the process, we created an new
mathematical model using two variable sets instead of a single variable set.
Equally important,we independently rediscovered the Nested Column Generation
technique, and we used it to propose an algorithm that led to a considerable
improvement on the previous algorithms that use the same Configuration
decomposition. When compared to the latest such existing study, our algorithm
achieved an accuracy gap of 1% as opposed to 14.3% for the previous study, and
a running time two orders of magnitude faster on average.","This paper presents a new method for solving the Routing and Spectral Assignment Problem in Elastic Optic Networking. The proposed solution is based on the following two steps:

the most challenging problems in network management. It is often formulated as
a mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem which requires the solution of
a large number of linear and nonlinear constraints. The problem is usually
approximated by a sequence of nested optimization problems where the first
problem is solved to obtain the optimal solution of the second problem. The
optimality of the solution obtained from the first problem is guaranteed by
the structure of the problem. However, the structure of the problem is not
always clear and it is difficult to determine the optimal solution of the
second problem. In this paper, we propose a new approach to solve the
routing and spectrum allocation problem in elastic optical networks based on
the nested column generation decomposition technique. The proposed method

Introduction {#sec:intro}
============

In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the probability that a given event will occur. For example, suppose that we have a set of $n$ events, each with a probability of occurrence $\pi_i$. Suppose further that we know the probabilities $\pi_1, \ldots, \pi_n$. Then it is possible to estimate the probability that any one of the events will occur by simply multiplying the probabilities together. However, if there is no information about the probabilities, then it is impossible to do so. Thus,","The routing of optical links is a key component to ensure reliable communication. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm that can solve both problems: (i) finding optimal paths between nodes; and (ii) allocating resources among them based on their distances from each other. The proposed method uses nested column generation as its core idea which consists two steps including firstly generating random columns with different lengths by using some known data structures such as binary search trees or dynamic programming algorithms while secondly merging these generated rows into one new row at any node position according to certain rules. We evaluate our approach through simulations where it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods under various scenarios involving multiple sources/destinations along same path but also shows good performance when compared against existing approaches like Dijkstra's shortest distance tree traversal(SDT), BFSM+DSTree etc., even though they are not designed specifically for elastic networks. Our code will be released soon after acceptance. This work has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions On Computers. It provides insights about how deep learning techniques could help us tackle complex real world tasks efficiently without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, due to space limitation, only part of results have been presented here so far."
cs,privGAN: Protecting GANs from membership inference attacks at low cost,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made releasing of synthetic
images a viable approach to share data without releasing the original dataset.
It has been shown that such synthetic data can be used for a variety of
downstream tasks such as training classifiers that would otherwise require the
original dataset to be shared. However, recent work has shown that the GAN
models and their synthetically generated data can be used to infer the training
set membership by an adversary who has access to the entire dataset and some
auxiliary information. Current approaches to mitigate this problem (such as
DPGAN) lead to dramatically poorer generated sample quality than the original
non--private GANs. Here we develop a new GAN architecture (privGAN), where the
generator is trained not only to cheat the discriminator but also to defend
membership inference attacks. The new mechanism provides protection against
this mode of attack while leading to negligible loss in downstream
performances. In addition, our algorithm has been shown to explicitly prevent
overfitting to the training set, which explains why our protection is so
effective. The main contributions of this paper are: i) we propose a novel GAN
architecture that can generate synthetic data in a privacy preserving manner
without additional hyperparameter tuning and architecture selection, ii) we
provide a theoretical understanding of the optimal solution of the privGAN loss
function, iii) we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model against several
white and black--box attacks on several benchmark datasets, iv) we demonstrate
on three common benchmark datasets that synthetic images generated by privGAN
lead to negligible loss in downstream performance when compared against
non--private GANs.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w0-D6Z_Q8k

the number of members increases exponentially with the number of
members. This phenomenon is known as *gauge invariance* which means that
membership information is preserved even if they are not included in the
member list. In this paper, we investigate the effect of gauge invariance on
a class of evolutionary equations where each member is assigned a unique
number called the *group membership*. We find that there is no significant
effect of group membership on the performance of the algorithm.
We also study the effect of group membership on the performance of the
algorithm. We find that it is more efficient to use the group membership
instead of the individual membership since the latter does not depend on
the particular set of parameters being considered.
In addition, we consider the effect of group membership on the performance
of the algorithm over a wide range of parameter values. We find that our
method performs better than the existing methods on a wide range of parameter
values.

cs,Near-Optimal Schedules for Simultaneous Multicasts,"We study the store-and-forward packet routing problem for simultaneous
multicasts, in which multiple packets have to be forwarded along given trees as
fast as possible.
This is a natural generalization of the seminal work of Leighton, Maggs and
Rao, which solved this problem for unicasts, i.e. the case where all trees are
paths. They showed the existence of asymptotically optimal $O(C + D)$-length
schedules, where the congestion $C$ is the maximum number of packets sent over
an edge and the dilation $D$ is the maximum depth of a tree. This improves over
the trivial $O(CD)$ length schedules.
We prove a lower bound for multicasts, which shows that there do not always
exist schedules of non-trivial length, $o(CD)$. On the positive side, we
construct $O(C+D+\log^2 n)$-length schedules in any $n$-node network. These
schedules are near-optimal, since our lower bound shows that this length cannot
be improved to $O(C+D) + o(\log n)$.","This paper presents a novel approach to the optimization of simultaneous multichannel scheduling. The proposed method is based on the concept of a multi-channel scheduling problem, which can be solved by using a single-channel scheduling problem.

The proposed method has been tested on two real-world scenarios: one with a fixed number of channels and one with a fixed number of channels. We also present a novel method for simultaneous multichannel scheduling in which the channel numbers are set to be equal to the number of channels. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance when the number of channels is less than or equal to the number of channels used in the simulation.

simulation results were obtained from the simulation of the same type of
network shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1 shows the simulation results for the three different types of

to the fact that the number of nodes does not increase linearly with the

physics,Self-dispersion of Two Natural Polysaccharides for Granular Composites,"We envision that dispersion between two polymeric materials on mesoscales
would create new composites with properties that are much more superior to the
components alone. Here we elucidate the dispersion between two of most abundant
natural polysaccharides, starch and chitosan, which form mesoscale composites
that may promise many applications. By using X-ray microscopic imaging,
small-angle X-ray scattering, and differential scanning calorimetry, we were
able to characterize the interactions of chitosan and starch in the mesoscale
composites. The morphology of the composite is far more complex from the simple
mixture of starch granules with a nominal size of a few micrometers and
chitosan microbundles of tens and hundreds of micrometers. This unique
morphology can only be explained by the enhanced miscibility of chitosan in a
starch granular matrix. It is evidenced that there is a possible ionic
interaction between the amino group in chitosan and the hydroxyl groups in
starch granules. Despite the limited solubility of chitosan in water, this
ionic interaction allows for the disassembly of chitosan microbundles within
the starch suspension. The result is a chemically stronger and more stable
granular composite formed by two biocompatible and biodegradable polysaccharide
polymers. The mechanism of chitosan to disperse throughout starch granules has
implications for the application of chitosan in water and other solvents.","The natural polysaccharide is a mixture of two naturally occurring monosaccharides, namely, glucose and galactose. The sugar content of the polymer is determined by its molecular weight (MW) and composition. The MW of the polymer is about 1,000 to 1,500 Mw. The composition of the polymer is related to the structure of the carbohydrate molecule. The glycosyl group in the polymer can be found as glycine or as an amino acid residue. The average MW of the polymer is about 1,200 to 1,300 Mw. The properties of the polymer are influenced by the nature of the carbohydrates present in the polymer. The most important property of the polymer is its ability to form stable complexes with other sugars. The complexation between the sugar and the polymer results in the formation of insoluble aggregates that are called granules. These granules are formed when the polymer is dissolved in water. The presence of these aggregates causes the precipitation of the polymer from the solution which then forms the gel. The precipitates may also contain other components such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. The amount of each component varies depending on the type of polymer used. The total amount of protein in the polymer depends on the degree","The self-dispersion problem arises from the fact that two natural polysaccharides
(polyethylene and polypropylene) are mixed together when they are subjected
to different forces. This phenomenon occurs because there is no common force
between these two materials. The solution obtained depends only on their relative
mass density; however, it is possible to obtain solutions which depend more
on mass densities than those determined by other factors. The main result
of this paper is:
1.  Self-dispersion of two natural polysaccharides is governed by three
   fundamental properties: 1) the total energy per unit volume must vanish
   at all points where one polymer molecule is bound to another monomer;
2) the number of molecules involved in each phase must increase linearly
   over the length of the chain; 3) the probability distribution function
    should not change much if particles move along chains whose lengths do
    not exceed some critical length scale.
2.  Self-dispersion of two natural polysaccharides is governed by four
   basic principles: 1) the internal structure of the polysacchialic units
    does not change","Granular materials are widely used in many industrial applications such as
food packaging, construction, and automotive industries. These materials
are often composed of natural polysaccharides which exhibit different
properties depending on the type of polysaccharide. For example, the
different properties of starch and cellulose depend on the degree of
polymerization. The self-diffusion coefficient of these polysaccharides
can be determined from the experimental data obtained from granular
composites. The self-diffusion coefficient of two natural polysaccharides
(cellulose and starch) were measured at different temperatures and
different concentrations. The self-diffusion coefficients of these two
polymers were found to be very similar. The self-diffusion coefficients of
these two polysaccharides were found to be independent of temperature and
concentration. The self-diffusion coefficients of these two polysaccharides
were found to be almost identical when they were dispersed in water.","The natural polysaccharide (NPS) is a natural polyphenol that has been
introduced into the food industry to improve its nutritional value. NPS is
considered as one of the most promising natural polymers due to their
natural structure and high molecular weight. However, the molecular weight
of NPS is still not enough to satisfy the requirements of the food industry.
Therefore, the research of NPS is an important step in developing new
nanoporous materials with superior properties. In this paper, we have
investigated the molecular weight of NPS and the molecular weight distribution
(MWD), which are the main factors affecting the molecular weight of NPS. The
results show that the molecular weight of NPS is mainly determined by the
molecular weight of NPS. Moreover, the molecular weight distribution of NPS
is also affected by the molecular weight of NPS. Therefore, the molecular weight
and MWD of NPS are closely related to each other. This study provides a
foundation for further research on the molecular weight and MWD of NPS. It
provides a foundation for the development of nanotechnology and nanocarriers
for granular composites.","This paper presents near-optimal scheduling policies for simultaneous multicast transmissions in a wireless network.

physics,Low-frequency one-electrode discharge in long tubes at low gas pressure,"The specific form of one electrode capacitive discharge was studied in long
tubes filled with high purity neon or argon at pressure 1-4 Torr. The main
feature of the discharge is the low rate (less than 10 kHz) of the voltage
pulses of given polarity which are applied to only one electrode of the tube,
while another one remains free or missing. This type of the discharge was named
one-electrode discharge (OED), and seems not to be described in previous
studies. The discharge is observed as a glowing plasma column which occupies
either entire tube or its part dependent on actual voltage amplitude and on its
rate. Current-volt characteristics, ignition thresholds and the OED length
changing patterns demonstrate features unknown for RF discharges. It was found
that the plasma generation mechanism in OED consists in formation and traveling
of the set of ionization waves (IW). It was shown that the wave motion is
characterized by a pronounced attenuation the patterns of which were
investigated by the time-position diagrams method. The attenuation specifies
the length of the occupied plasma area as well as other OED parameters.
Kinematic model of the wave propagation is proposed. This model allows to
estimate the electric field in different OED points as well as average electron
concentration via the current measurements; the typical values of the above
parameters are $5 V/cm$ and $10^9-10^{10}$ $cm^{-3}$. It was shown that
nonhomogeneous electric field behind the IW front creates the conditions for
appearance of plasma channel striations observed in the experiment. The
stationary striations found in neon are more distinctive for negative polarity
OED. It was shown that ionization-drift mechanism with account of metastable
states existence in plasma seems to be much adequate for the OED striation
description.","High-frequency one-electrode discharge in short tubes at high pressure

difference equation approach allows us to study the effect of different
temperatures on the properties of the system under consideration. This technique
was developed by Cole and Musslimani from numerical simulations of the
transport of high density particles through a tube filled with liquid helium
(H2O). They found that the LOFE method provides accurate results when the
pressure drop across the tube is small compared to the average velocity of the
particles within the tube. The LOFDE method uses a non-stationary approximation
to describe the behavior of the particle distribution function over time.
The LOFDE method does not require any additional assumptions about the
fluid composition inside the tube; it only requires two independent variables
such as temperature and volume. The LOFDE method gives good agreement between
the experimental data and the numerical simulations.
In addition, the LOFDE method offers significant advantages over the
experimental method due to the fact that the LOFDE method includes no external
physical effects such as heat transfer, diffusion, etc.
This makes it possible to use the LOFDE method directly without requiring any
additional assumptions","The low frequency one-electrode discharge in long tubes at low gas pressures
has attracted much attention due to its potential applications in high power
electrical generators. The discharge is initiated by a short pulse of high
voltage from a high voltage source. The discharge current is proportional to
the square root of the applied voltage. The discharge current is strongly
dependent on the gas pressure. The discharge current is very sensitive to the
gas pressure. The discharge current is highly dependent on the gas temperature.
The discharge current is also strongly dependent on the gas composition. The
discharge current is not only dependent on the gas pressure but also depends
on the gas composition. The discharge current is also strongly dependent on
the gas temperature. The discharge current is also strongly dependent on the

low-frequency one-electrode discharge in a tube. The results show that the
high-pressure gas flow causes a significant reduction in the discharge rate
(i.e., the time to reach the maximum discharge) and an increase in the
temperature of the discharge. This effect is also observed in the case of
two-dimensional (2D)-type discharge. In addition, the temperature of the
discharge is reduced by a factor of 2.5. We also show that the two-dimensional
reaction is more efficient in the case of a two-layer structure. Finally, we
show that the effects of the high-pressure gas flow are not limited to the
single-layer structure. Our results suggest that the high-pressure gas flow
can be used as a means to reduce the number of components in a tube. However,
the use of the high-pressure gas flow in a tube is not limited to the single-
layer structure. For example, it can be used for the removal of the
susceptible bacteria from the surface of a tube.","The self-dispersion behavior of two natural polysaccharides, namely, xyloglucan and chitosan, was investigated in the presence of aqueous solutions. The results showed that the dispersion behaviors of these two polysaccharides were influenced by the concentration of the solution. The effects of the concentration on the dispersion properties of xyloglucan and chitosan were different. The dispersion characteristics of xyloglucan increased with the increase of the concentration while those of chitosan decreased. The effect of the concentration on the dispersion property of chitosan was more significant than that of xyloglucan. The influence of the concentration on the dispersion stability of xyloglucan was greater than that of chitosan. The dispersion stability of xyloglucan was better than that of chitosan. The dispersion stability of xyloglucan was better than that of chitosan at all concentrations. The dispersion stability of xyloglucan was better than that of chitosan at all concentrations. The dispersion stability of xyloglucan was better than that of chitosan at all concentrations. The","We report on the electrochemical behaviour of a single electrode immersed into an
islanded tube with different lengths. The electrodes are made from two thin,
nonconducting films and their electrical properties were investigated by means
of impedance spectroscopy (ZS) measurements as well as cyclic voltammetry (CV). We
observed that for all studied cases there is no significant difference between them
in terms of CV response to hydrogen peroxide oxidation or H2O2 reduction up to 1%
Hg/Hg0 = 0.5 V vs Ag|AgCl reference electrode potentials. However, when we used
the same electrolyte solution but changed its concentration it was observed that
for longer distances (>10 cm), i.e., larger diameter (<1 mm) compared to shorter
diameters (~0.8 mm), both CVs showed similar responses towards oxygen evolution
and hydroxide production. This suggests that this effect can be attributed to the
difference in surface area rather than differences in chemical composition. In
addition, our results show how such small changes in geometry affect not only the
properties of individual components but also those of whole systems."
physics,Broadband and Wide-Angle Invisibility with PT-Symmetric 2D-Weyl Semimetal,"Inspired by the magnificent features of two-dimensional (2D) materials which
aroused much of the interest in recent materials science research, we study
PT-symmetric 2D Weyl semimetal (WSM) to reveal the broadband and wide-angle
invisible configurations in a PT-symmetric optical slab system. Desired
unidirectional reflectionlessness and invisibility phenomena is obtained by the
optimal control of system parameters. We unravel the mystery of broadband and
wide-angle invisibility in regular slab materials with finite refractive
indices by means of the plenary expressions. We show that materials whose
refractive indices relatively small (usually around $\eta =1$) give rise to
quite a lot broadband and wide-angle (almost all incidence angles) invisible
configurations. This is not observed with any 2D material other than 2D WSMs.
Our findings suggest a concrete expedience to experimental realizations in this
direction.","This paper presents a new method for the detection of 3D-weights in two-dimensional (2D) space. The method is based on the use of a 2D-weighted image, which is obtained by applying a 2D-weighted image to a 2D-image from a 3D-space. This technique can be used to detect 3D-weights in both 2D and 3D spaces.

Introduction
============

The 3D-weights are an important part of the 3D-image processing system. They provide information about the position or orientation of objects within a scene [@Bertschinger]. The 3D-weights have been widely used in various applications such as:

to study the effects of different types of nonlinearities on the propagation
of signals. This enables us to understand the effect of various kinds of
nonlinearities on the propagation of signals.
In this paper, we consider a two dimensional system consisting of a
two dimensional linearized Hamiltonian coupled to a discrete set of
differential operators which are given by the following matrix:
$$\begin{aligned}
H=\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 
\end{array}\right) \label{eqn:2D_Hamiltonian}\end{aligned}$$
where $x$ is the position vector at time $t$, $\mathbf{h}=(h_{ij})$.
The matrices $(\hat{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}^k)^{*}$ represent the eigenvalues of the
Hamiltonian when it is diagonalized. The corresponding eigenvectors are denoted
by $\lambda_k = \sqrt{|\","The broad band and wide-angle invisibility effect occurs when a 2D-Weyl semimetal
is placed in a strong magnetic field. This effect is due to the fact that the
2D-Weyl semimetal is a topological insulator. The broad band and wide-angle
invisibility effect arises from the fact that the 2D-Weyl semimetal is a
topological insulator. The broad band and wide-angle invisibility effect
occurs when a 2D-Weyl semimetal is placed in a strong magnetic field. This
effect is due to the fact that the 2D-Weyl semimetal is a topological insulating
material. The broad band and wide-angle invisibility effect appears because
the 2D-Weyl semimetals are topological insulators. The broad band and wide-angle
invisibility effect may be useful in the design of quantum devices such as
quantum computers.","The wide-angle invisibility of a 2D-weyl semimetal is a key feature for the
performance of quantum optics. We present an experimental demonstration of
the wide-angle invisibility of this material by using two different
templates, one with a narrow-range (0.1$^{\circ}$) and the other with a wider
(2$^{\circ}$) range of angles. The results show that the narrow-range invisibility
is not only possible but also very useful for the performance of quantum
optics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the wide-angle invisibility can be
achieved by using a thin film of a 2D-woven fabric with a wide-angle invisibility
and a thin film of a 2D-thin film of a 2D-wavelength-doped material. This
demonstration opens up new possibilities for the design of quantum optics
devices. Furthermore, we show that the wide-angle invisibility can be
applied to a variety of applications such as optical imaging, quantum
photonics, and quantum information processing.","The effect of the electrode on the discharge is studied by means of a numerical simulation. The results show that the discharge current increases with the increase of the distance between the electrodes, and the discharge current density decreases with the increase of the gap between the electrodes. The discharge current density reaches a maximum when the distance between the electrodes is about 0.5 mm. The discharge current density has an inverse relationship with the gap between the electrodes. The discharge current density can be reduced to zero if the gap between the electrodes is less than 1 mm.Q:

This invention relates to a method for the production of a polyureth","In this paper, we propose a novel method for invisibility based on the topology of an effective band structure. The proposed approach is to design two types of symmetries: (i) time reversal symmetry in which light propagates along one direction while its phase remains unchanged; and (ii) mirror reflection symmetry that reflects incident wave into another plane perpendicular to it. We show how these asymmetry can be used as either gain or loss mediums by designing appropriate material properties such as refractive index difference between them. This allows us to realize broadband visible/invisible states through tuning their dispersion relation using external electric field control. Furthermore, our scheme also enables wide angle visibility due to both spatial mode mixing and temporal modulation induced from different propagation directions at any frequency. Our work provides new opportunities towards realizing high performance optical devices operating under broad bandwidth without sacrificing transparency. It could pave way toward future applications including stealthy sensing systems, quantum information processing etc., where conventional materials are not suitable because they have low absorption efficiency. Moreover, since all components involved in traditional methods cannot operate simultaneously, there will always exist some tradeoffs among various parameters affecting device performances. Hereby combining multiple advantages together makes possible realization of highly efficient optoelectronic system."
physics,Comparison of open and solid falling retroreflector gravimeters,"We study whether the optical properties of a solid glass retroreflector
influence the value of the acceleration of gravity $g$ determined by dropping
both solid and open retroreflectors in an absolute ballistic gravimeter. The
retroreflectors have equivalent optical centers and are dropped from the same
height, at a fixed location, in the same gravimeter while recording time data
corresponding to fixed fringe separation intervals of 400 fringes. The data for
both types of retroreflectors are processed with commercial software, as well
as with independently developed software based on a relativistic treatment of
the phase difference between reference beam and test beams, and a realistic
treatment of the effect of frequency modulation, with modulation index $\beta
\gg 1$, on the interference signal. After applying corrections for polar
motion, barometric admittance, tides, and ocean loading we find agreement
between the values of $g$ determined with both types of retroreflectors,
whether processed with commercial software or with our independently developed
software. We suggest two procedures for computing relativistic corrections; the
two methods agree to better than .01 $\mu$Gal.","The comparison between the two is based on the following:

1.  The distance from the center of gravity to the surface of the object being measured, as a function of time;
2.  The distance at which the gravitational force acting on the object reaches its maximum value;
3.  The magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity applied to the object during this period (i.e., when it falls into the atmosphere);
4.  The velocity in the air after reaching the ground level for that period;
5.  The speed of sound before reaching the ground level for that period;
6.  The height of the object under consideration;
7.  The length of the object's path over which the impact occurs;
8.  The thickness of the object itself;
9.  The mass density of the object or any other material present in the environment around the object;
10.  The volume of the space surrounding the object;
11.  The area occupied by the object within the vicinity of the impact point;
12.  The size of the object inside the region where the impact occurred;
13.  The relative position of the object with respect to the earth plane;
14.  The","The retroreflector gravimeter is a new type of gravimeter which uses a
solid surface reflecting off a liquid crystal material. It consists of a
receiver body made of a transparent plastic material called a retroreflector
which reflects off a liquid crystal display panel. This receiver body is
covered by a transparent glass plate which covers the receiver body from
the outside while it is exposed to the atmosphere. The retroreflectors are
also covered by a transparent dielectric layer which acts as a barrier between
the two bodies. The retroreflectors are designed to reflect off the liquid
crystal surfaces of the transverse plane of the screen so that they do not
contribute to the radiation field produced by the liquid crystal displays.
The retroreflectors are mounted on a flat surface such that their reflection
offensures no matter how far away the reflected light passes through them.
The retroreflectors are placed at different angles relative to the screen
to ensure that they will only pass along the horizontal direction when viewed
from above. They are therefore considered ""radial"" because they move about
the screen without being visible due to the presence of the mirror.
The retroreflectors are typically positioned within the vertical plane of the
screen","The open falling retroreflector (ORFR) and solid falling retroreflector (SFR)
gravimeters are two types of retroreflectors that are commonly used in
gravitational wave detectors. Both gravimeters are based on the same principle
of retroreflection, but they differ in the way they measure the retroreflected
wave. The ORFR uses a single detector, while the SFR uses two detectors. The
ORFR is more sensitive than the SFR because it uses a larger number of detectors
to measure the retroreflected wave. The ORFR is less sensitive than the SFR
because it uses a smaller number of detectors to measure the retroreflected
wave. The ORFR is more sensitive than the SFR because it uses a larger number
of detectors to measure the retroreflected wave.","The aim of this paper is to compare the performance of two different
open-and-solid fallers, a high-performance liquid crystal reflector (LCR)
(HPCF), with the same material properties. The HPCF has a high-quality
material with a high-density spherical core, and the liquid crystal reflector
has a high-intensity beam that is able to produce a high-resolution image. We
present an experimental study on the performance of the HPCF in terms of
the number of reflections and the quality of the image. In addition, we show
that the HPCF can be used as a good faller for the liquid crystal reflector
with a high-power beam. Finally, we present a comparison between the
competing materials and the HPCF. Our results indicate that the HPCF is
better than the other materials in terms of the number of reflections and
quality of the image. This is due to the fact that the liquid crystal
receivers are more sensitive to the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules
than the HPCF. Moreover, the HPCF is better than the other materials in terms
of the number of reflections and the quality of the image.","The 2D-Weyl semimetals are a class of topological insulators that have been predicted to host gapless surface states. The discovery of the 2D-Weyl semimetal has triggered a renewed interest in the physics of these materials, which is motivated by their potential applications in spintronics [@Kane; @Bernevig]. Here we report on the observation of broadband and wide-angle inversion symmetry breaking in a 2D-Weyl semimetal, which is realized using a combination of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We find that the 2D-Weyl semimetal is characterized by a strong anisotropy in the momentum distribution function $n(k_x,k_y)$, which is consistent with the presence of a chiral anomaly. We also observe a large inelastic scattering rate at the Fermi level, which is consistent with the presence of a gap in the spectrum. Our results provide evidence for the existence of a 2D-Weyl semimetal in the family of 2D-Dirac semimetals. ]{}

Introduction {#sec:intro}","The performance, accuracy, precision, stability, cost-effectiveness, ease
of use, reliability, robustness to environmental conditions (e.g., temperature)

In this paper we present an overview about different types of fallers which have
been developed over time: pendulum based devices such as gyrocompasses; optical
devices like photodetectors with integrated optics detectors; mechanical systems
like accelerometers using microcombs etc. We also compare them against each

physics,Spin selectivity through chiral polyalanine monolayers on semiconductors,"Electrical generation of polarized spins in nonmagnetic materials is of great
interest for the underlying physics and device potential. One such mechanism is
chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), with which structural chirality
leads to different electric conductivities for electrons of opposite spins. The
resulting effect of spin filtering has been reported for a number of chiral
molecules. However, the microscopic mechanism and manifestation of CISS in
practical device structures remain controversial; in particular, the Onsager
relation is understood to preclude linear-response detection of CISS by a
ferromagnet. Here, we report direct evidence of CISS in two-terminal devices of
chiral molecules on the magnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As: In vertical
heterojunctions of (Ga,Mn)As/AHPA-L molecules/Au, we observed characteristic
linear- and nonlinear-response magnetoconductance, which directly verifies spin
filtering by the AHPA-L molecules and spin detection by the (Ga,Mn)As. The
results constitute definitive signature of CISS-induced spin valve effect, a
core spintronic functionality, in apparent violation of the Onsager
reciprocity. The results present a promising route to semiconductor spintronics
free of any magnetic material.","The spin-selective properties of chiral polyalanine monolayers are investigated by means of the spin-spin interaction model. The results show that the effect of a change in the orientation of the layers is to increase the effective thickness of the layer, which leads to an increase in the number of spins per unit cell. The influence of the interlayer coupling constant (K) on the spin selection can be explained as follows: When K = 0 or 1, the system has no net charge and thus only one type of charges exist for each direction. When K = 2 or 3, there exists two types of charged states with different valencies. The first state consists of electrons having opposite polarizations; while the second kind of electron belongs to the same class. The former corresponds to positive charges whereas the latter represents negative ones. The effects of these interactions are discussed in detail below.

[","The spin selectivity theory describes how spins interact with each other via
the interaction between two adjacent layers of conducting materials. This type
of effect occurs when one layer of material undergoes phase transitions from
conducting to nonconducting states due to interactions among neighboring layers.
The effective Hamiltonian describing such phases may be written as:
H = \_[l,m]{} \_[l,m]{} \_[l,m]{} + \_[l,m]{} \_[l,n]{} where $\phi_{l,m}$ are Pauli matrices acting on $l$th layer respectively $(l=1,2,\cdots,L)$; $\psi_{l,m}$ are eigenfunctions of the corresponding matrix elements given by: $$\begin{aligned}

","Polymer based chiral materials are promising candidates for next generation
electronic devices due to their unique properties such as high mobility,
high thermal stability, and tunable optical and electrical properties.
However, these materials are usually synthesized from expensive and toxic
reagents which limits their applications. In this work, we report the synthesis
of chiral polymers containing a chiral amino acid residue via a simple
chemical route. The chirality of the amino acid residue is controlled by
the nature of the solvent used during the polymerization reaction. The
polymers were characterized by FTIR, NMR, XRD, SEM, DSC, TG, etc. The
polymers were found to be highly soluble in water and organic solvents but
insoluble in common organic solvents. The chirality of the amino acid
residue could be controlled by the nature of the solvent used during the
polymerization reaction. The chirality of the amino acid residue may be
controlled by the nature of the solvent used during the polymerization
reaction. The chirality of the amino acid residue may be controlled by the
nature of the solvent used during the polymerization reaction.","The spin selectivity of a polymer-based material is determined by the
interactions between the polarizability and the electrostatic potential of the
polymer. The interplay between the electrostatic potential and the polarizability
of the polymer leads to an increase in the number of states per unit area of the
nanoparticle, which is proportional to the square of the ratio of the polarizabilities
to the electrostatic potential. This result is consistent with the experimental
results of the spin selectivity of a polymer-coated silicon wafer. We show that
the effect of the electrostatic potential on the spin selectivity of a polymer
is due to the interaction between the polarizability and the electrostatic
potential of the polymer. In particular, the influence of the polarizability on
its spin selectivity is found to be significant for the first time. Our results
show that the effects of the polarizability on the spin selectivity of a
plastic polymer are not only important for the initial phase of the polymer, but
also can be important for the final phase of the polymer. Therefore, the
spinnings of the polymer are influenced by the interactions between the
polarizability and the electrostatic.","Comparison of open and solid falling retroreflector gravimeters

monolayer, namely an all-trans peptide containing two phenyl rings linked by one
carbon atom. The resulting molecule is called as""chiralpolyalanines""and has been
synthesized in solution and deposited onto various substrates such as silicon
(Si), gold (Au) or indium phosphides (InP). We have studied its photophysical
properties using femtosecond time resolved absorption spectroscopy to probe for
the possible changes due to different conformations/orientation of these molecules
on Si, Au and InP surfaces. Our results show that both enantiomers exhibit very
different spectral features with respect to their respective symmetric forms. This
is further confirmed when we compare them against each other at room temperature
using transient reflectance measurements which also reveal significant differences
between the asymmetric species. Further investigation reveals that this effect
can be attributed to strong coupling between electronic transitions from excited
states localized within individual amino groups. These findings are supported by
a detailed analysis based upon density functional theory calculations where it was
found that they can undergo large structural distortions leading to substantial
changes in vibronic structure."

1. Introduction
===============

The incidence rate of HCC has been increasing rapidly over the past few decades ([@b1-etm-0-0-8241]). Although many studies have shown that HCC is one of the most common causes of cancer worldwide, its prevalence remains low compared with other cancers ([@b2-etm-0-0-8241],[@b3-etm-0-0-8241]). The majority of cases are caused by viral hepatitis viruses (HVs), which infect about 10% of the population ([@b4-etm-0-0-8241]).","Hepatic diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide due to their
increasing prevalence rates and increasing mortality rates. These health
problems pose significant challenges for healthcare providers who wish to
provide effective treatments for these patients. One approach to address these
challenges is to develop a new class of nonlinear systems which may be more
efficient than existing systems. This type of nonlinear system could be useful
for developing new therapies for chronic disease such as cancer treatment.

The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of the spatial beam self-cleaning technique by using a novel, highly efficient, and scalable technique called spatial beam self-cleaning (SBS). The SBS technique consists of two steps: firstly, an optical fiber is placed in a vacuum chamber; secondly, the laser beam is focused on the surface of the fiber; then, the light from the fiber is reflected off the surface of the fiber and back into the vacuum chamber through the lens system. The resulting image can be used as a template for the construction of a large-scale optical fiber. The results show that the proposed technique can be applied to a wide range of applications including imaging, radar, and other types of optical systems.

a spatial discretization of the original system at each step. The temporal

physics,Interpretable Conservation Law Estimation by Deriving the Symmetries of Dynamics from Trained Deep Neural Networks,"Understanding complex systems with their reduced model is one of the central
roles in scientific activities. Although physics has greatly been developed
with the physical insights of physicists, it is sometimes challenging to build
a reduced model of such complex systems on the basis of insights alone. We
propose a novel framework that can infer the hidden conservation laws of a
complex system from deep neural networks (DNNs) that have been trained with
physical data of the system. The purpose of the proposed framework is not to
analyze physical data with deep learning, but to extract interpretable physical
information from trained DNNs. With Noether's theorem and by an efficient
sampling method, the proposed framework infers conservation laws by extracting
symmetries of dynamics from trained DNNs. The proposed framework is developed
by deriving the relationship between a manifold structure of time-series
dataset and the necessary conditions for Noether's theorem. The feasibility of
the proposed framework has been verified in some primitive cases for which the
conservation law is well known. We also apply the proposed framework to
conservation law estimation for a more practical case that is a large-scale
collective motion system in the metastable state, and we obtain a result
consistent with that of a previous study.","The Symmetries of Dynamical Systems are derived using the dynamics of a neural network. The resulting equations are then used to derive the corresponding equations for the evolution of the system under consideration.

for various types of nonlinearities including diffusion, heat capacity, etc.
However, it is not clear how these features could be incorporated into the
model itself. For example, if there were no additional constraints imposed upon
the system at hand, would any existing DNN model still contain all relevant
constraints?

a new constraint which may lead to undesirable results. We will discuss
how this can be done through a simple numerical simulation study.

The design of metamaterials has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their potential applications in various fields such as optical communications, sensing, and imaging [@Makris_book]. In","We demonstrate coupling of a silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) photonic crystal
(PC) with an on-chip SiO$_2$/SOI interface. The PC is fabricated by etching and
is coupled into the top layer, which consists of two layers: one for light in
the bulk region and another for surface plasmon polaritons at its bottom side. We
demonstrate that this structure can be used as both optical resonator or filter
and electrostatic modulator. In addition we show how it could serve also as high
performance integrated circuit platform for sensing applications such as biosensors
or imaging systems based on Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). Our work
provides new opportunities towards integration between different types of metasurfaces
in order to realize functional devices combining advantages from each type of

concluded that there were no such things as galaxies without their stars.
This controversy led him to conclude that it would be impossible to explain
the existence of any other kind of matter beyond our own solar system.
However, he later argued that if one could describe all these objects
without having them being made out of dust, they would not exist.
In fact, his argument had already been challenged by many astronomers who
had suggested that some sort of cosmic background might be responsible for
the appearance of dark matter at early times.
Although most physicists agree that black holes are indeed nothing but
dust, others argue that even though space itself may be composed of hydrogen
and helium, which do not contain anything like atomic nuclei, those particles
may still be able to carry energy from outside through gravity.
These arguments seem more plausible than either side's claims.
However, while both sides claim that light does not travel much faster than
the speed of light, neither side argues that radiation cannot travel much
faster than the speed of light.
As far as I know, nobody has ever claimed that gravitational waves are
not caused by photons.
However, what about the possibility","The great debate between the two most popular approaches to the numerical
simulation of partial differential equations (PDEs) is whether the numerical
method should be based on the Runge-Kutta or Crank-Nicolson schemes.
Runge-Kutta methods are based on the idea that the solution of the PDE at each
time step can be approximated by a linear combination of the previous solutions
of the PDE. The Crank-Nicolson method is based on the idea that the solution
of the PDE at each time step can be approximated by a linear combination of the
previous solutions of the PDE.
Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages. The Runge-Kutta method
has many attractive features such as high efficiency, but it requires a
large number of time steps to converge. The Crank-Nicolson method has fewer
attractive features such as high efficiency, but it requires a large number of
time steps to converge.

the history of science: the scientific community and the scientific
community's own interests. We argue that the scientific community is
universally dominant, and that the scientific community's interests are
substantially different from those of the scientific community. The
scientific community's interests are not necessarily identical to those of the
public; they are distinct from each other. In this paper we propose an
alternative to the scientific community's interests, which is to propose a
new set of rules for the scientific community to be used by the scientific
contributors. This new set of rules is based on the concept of the
""dynamic equilibrium"", which is a result of the fact that the public has a
different equilibrium than the private one. Our proposed rule is based on the
fact that the public can choose to have a different equilibrium than the
private one. It is shown that the dynamic equilibrium is stable under the
same conditions as the static equilibrium. Finally, we show how the dynamic

The study is based on data from three sources: (1) interviews with experts, including those who have been involved in developing or implementing such systems; (2) surveys conducted by organizations that provide support services related to health information technology; and (3) analyses using statistical methods. We find strong evidence supporting both sides' positions but conclude there are significant differences between them regarding their views about how they should be implemented. In particular, we argue against relying solely upon telemonitoring as part of this discussion because it does not take into account other important aspects like privacy issues and patient safety concerns. This conclusion may help policymakers make informed decisions when deciding which type of surveillance method will best serve patients and society at large. However, our findings also suggest some areas where further research might improve current understanding of these debates.

physics,On the fundamental limitations of imaging with evanescent waves,"There has been significant interest in imaging and focusing schemes that use
evanescent waves to beat the diffraction limit, such as those employing
negative refractive index materials or hyperbolic metamaterials. The
fundamental issue with all such schemes is that the evanescent waves quickly
decay between the imaging system and sample, leading to extremely weak field
strengths. Using an entropic definition of spot size which remains well defined
for arbitrary beam profiles, we derive rigorous bounds on this evanescent
decay. In particular, we show that the decay length is only $w / \pi e \approx
0.12 w$, where $w$ is the spot width in the focal plane, or $\sqrt{A} / 2 e
\sqrt{\pi} \approx 0.10 \sqrt{A}$, where $A$ is the spot area. Practical
evanescent imaging schemes will thus most likely be limited to focal distances
less than or equal to the spot width.","
The main goal of this paper is to provide a new approach to understanding the nature of wave propagation in non-linear optics. The key idea is to use an optical system that has been designed for such purposes, and then apply it to real-world situations where there is no known way to obtain information about light propagation.

Introduction
============

Wave propagation in non-linear optics (NLO) is one of the most important problems in modern physics. In particular, NLO can be used to study how photons propagate through matter without being absorbed by any other body or object. This problem was first studied by [@KL] who showed that if we take into account only the effects of gravity on the photon’s path length distribution at wavelengths shorter than 1 micron, which are much longer than the wavelength of light emitted by the observer, then our theory predicts that all modes will have their own absorption coefficient $\kappa$ as well as its dependence on the distance between the source and the observer.

In order to understand the origin of these phenomena, it is useful to consider the effect of radiation pressure on the properties of materials like silicon dioxide. In fact, when studying the properties of material under different pressures, it is necessary to know what","The use of evanescent waves in image processing is well known. This type of
wave propagation allows us to study wave propagation through non-uniform
waves. The basic idea behind the evanescent wave approach is to propagate
waves at different speeds along the direction of propagation. The speed of
the propagating wave depends on the velocity dispersion $\varepsilon$ of the
wavefront $u$. The main advantage of such a technique is that it does not
require any additional information about the position of the wavefront but only
its momentum distribution function. The key point here is that if one wishes
to apply the TDSR method directly on a given domain without having to deal
with other types of problems like viscosity, turbulence, etc., one must take
care when applying the TDSR method to images which are spatially uniform over
a large area.
In this paper, we will focus on the application of the TDSR method to
images where there is no spatial separation between the two domains.
We will consider three cases:
1. The case where the two domains are separated by a distance $r$ from each other;
2. The case where the two domains are both contained in","In this paper, we consider the problem of imaging evanescent waves from a
point source at infinity. We derive a general expression for the field amplitude
at any point inside the source region. We then apply this expression to the
problem of imaging evanescent waves from a point source at some distance away
from the source. We find that the image intensity is not well approximated by
the field amplitude at the location of the source. This result is due to the
fact that the field amplitude at the location of the source is not necessarily
a good approximation to the field outside the source. To overcome this issue,
we introduce a new imaging method based on the fundamental limitation of
imaging evanescent waves: the field amplitude at the location of the source
is not necessarily a good approximation to the field outside the source.","The evanescent wave (EVW) is a nonlinear electromagnetic wave that is
associated with the propagation of light in the medium. The EVW is an
inertial wave that is generated by the interaction between two particles
(electrons and protons). It is well known that the EVW is not only sensitive
to the spatial distribution of the particles, but also to their velocity
distribution. In this paper we study the EVW using a non-Hermitian model
that is based on the Maxwell equations. We show that the EVW is characterized
by a non-trivial dependence on the particle velocity distribution. This
characterization is achieved by considering the time-dependent part of the
evolution equation. Our results show that the EVW is robust against the
non-stationary part of the evolution equation. Furthermore, we show that the
viscosity of the EVW is strongly dependent on the particle velocity profile.
We also show that the EVW is stable against the non-uniformly distributed
particle velocity profile. Finally, we present numerical simulations of the
propagation of the EVW in the presence of a magnetic field.","The Tachyon Nexus: An Educational Resource on Tachyons and Time Travel

the case where we have access only to one partial Fourier component (i.e., at
most two spatial frequencies), it is impossible to reconstruct any information
about this object from its scattered field alone: The reconstructed fields are
either singular or contain spurious components which make them useless for further
processing and analysis purposes. This result holds even if there exist other
partial-fourier coefficients available; i. e., when more than just 2 frequency
components can be measured simultaneously by our setup. In particular, such
coefficients do not necessarily belong to distinct spectral bands but rather form
a continuous spectrum spanning all possible values between 0 and 1. As far as I am
aware, no previous work has addressed these issues so systematically. To address
these questions, here we propose new methods based on generalized Hilbert space
methods combined with deep learning techniques. Our results demonstrate both good
performance compared against state-of-the-art algorithms while also being able
to extract useful features without losing too much accuracy. Furthermore, they
reveal some interesting properties about what happens under certain conditions
when multiple modes interact during propagation through media."

The MIM layer is made of a thin insulating film composed of a polycrystalline silicon dioxide (PcO), which has been grown on a silicon substrate by sputtering in order to form a Pd/SiO2 heterojunction. A second metallic layer is formed on the PcO surface by depositing a p-type impurity into the SiO2 layer. The resulting SC exhibits high electrical resistivity and low thermal stability. The devices are characterized by very high current density and excellent performance as compared to conventional superconductors. The results show that the proposed superconducting device can be used for applications such as switching power supplies, solar cells, and other electronic devices.

In addition, we present some","The superconducting transition temperature (TCT) of two materials is often referred to as the
""superconducting transition temperature"". This refers to their thermal conductivity which depends upon many factors including material composition, doping concentration, electron density, etc. These are all related to electronic structure and charge carriers such as holes, electrons, impurities, etc. The TCT may vary from one material to another depending upon how it is measured. For example, the TCT of a metal oxide is typically determined by measuring the electrical resistivity at room temperature. The measurement of the resistance will depend upon whether the sample is made of metals or oxides. The current measurements require accurate knowledge of the dielectric constant of the samples so they must be accurately calibrated. The determination of the dielectric constant of a given material requires precise calibration of the dielectric constant of each individual material. The accuracy of these techniques is critical because any error in determining the dielectric constant of a material should be small enough to not affect the results obtained.
In addition to the above references, there are other publications dealing with the effects of different types of disorder on the TCT of various materials. For example, the TCT of a metal oxide is usually determined by measuring the electric","Super stretchable materials are promising candidates for next generation

Introduction {#sec:intro}
============

In the last decade, evanescent waves have been used for imaging applications [@Boyd; @Kraus; @Liu; @Shen; @Wang]. The main advantage of evanescent waves is that they can penetrate through a thick medium. However, their penetration depth is limited due to the fact that they are not able to penetrate through a thin layer. This limitation can be overcome if one uses a phase shifter instead of an evanescent wave. In this paper we will show how to obtain a phase shift without using any additional phase shifter. We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this method.

Introduction
============

In this paper we consider two different types of tilted images: those obtained with a microscope objective lens and those obtained with a camera lens. In both cases there are no differences between the image taken from the same object or that produced by another type of instrument.

The first case concerns the imaging process used to obtain these images. The second example concerns the measurement of the inclination angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of the objects on the surface of the microscope objective lens. The latter has been studied extensively [@Berthelot; @Kurz].

The aim of this paper is to study the effect of changing the orientation of the lenses relative to the axis of the microscope objective when they are viewed at different distances from the focus point. The results presented here show that it is possible to obtain very good results if the position of the focal point changes during the observation time.

The main idea behind the present paper is as follows. We will use the following","The tilt angle distribution function (TAF) is defined as:
$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eqn:taft}
\tau(x,y) &=& \frac{1}{2}\left( x^2 + y^2 - 2x+y\right) \\

images taken at different angles. The TV is related to the variance of the
angle of the image planes. The tilt variance is often used to quantify the
quality of the image reconstruction from a set of images. The tilt variance
is usually measured along the direction of the tilt axis. The tilt variance
can be calculated either analytically or numerically. The tilt variance is
often expressed in terms of the tilt angle and the tilt distance. The tilt
variance is not only sensitive to the tilt angle but also to the tilt distance.
The tilt variance is commonly estimated by the following equation:

investigate the geometric properties of the tilt angle in a scanning oblique
plane microscope. We first present the geometric properties of the tilt angle
for a two-dimensional (2D) plane microscope, and then we show that the tilt
angle can be expressed as a function of the tilt angle. Our results show that
a 2D plane microscope with a tilt angle of 0.5 degrees is more stable than a
3D plane microscope with a tilt angle of 1 degree. Moreover, we show that the
geometric properties of the tilt angle can be expressed as a function of the
orientation of the sample. Finally, we discuss the possible applications of

of scanning planes, which is equivalent to an ensemble average over all possible
tilts. The results show that this averaging procedure leads to two main effects:
(i) it can be used as a tool to reduce both angular spread and mean-square error;
and (ii) its effect on image quality depends strongly on whether or not there is
a preferred direction with respect to each scan line. We also discuss how these
effects may affect other imaging techniques such as phase contrast tomography. In
particular we demonstrate their importance by studying different types of tilting
angles including those induced through rotation about arbitrary axes. Finally, we
show that our approach allows us to obtain images from any type of sample without
the need to perform additional calibration procedures. This opens up new avenues
for quantitative analysis using nonlinear optics methods based solely on measured
data rather than requiring prior knowledge of orientation angles. Our work thus
provides important insights into various aspects related to optical systems
including scattering theory, beam shaping devices, etc., where information on
orientation angle plays a crucial role."
physics,Exploring the magnetic properties of the largest single molecule magnets,"The giant $\{ \mathrm{Mn}_{70} \}$ and $\{ \mathrm{Mn}_{84} \}$ wheels are
the largest nuclearity single-molecule magnets synthesized to date and
understanding their magnetic properties poses a challenge to theory. Starting
from first principles calculations, we explore the magnetic properties and
excitations in these wheels using effective spin Hamiltonians. We find that the
unusual geometry of the superexchange pathways leads to weakly coupled $\{
\mathrm{Mn}_{7} \}$ subunits carrying an effective $S=2$ spin. The spectrum
exhibits a hierarchy of energy scales and massive degeneracies, with the lowest
energy excitations arising from Heisenberg-ring-like excitations of the $\{
\mathrm{Mn}_{7} \}$ subunits around the wheel, at energies consistent with the
observed temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility. We further
suggest an important role for weak longer-range couplings in selecting the
precise spin ground-state of the $\mathrm{Mn}$ wheels out of the nearly
degenerate ground-state band.","The magnetic properties of a magnet are determined by its structure and composition. The most common examples include:

a) a liquid crystal, which is made up of two layers of molecules separated by an insulating film;

b) a solid-state material with high electrical conductivity (such as a metal or semiconductor), such as a metal oxide, that has been formed on one surface of a substrate to form a thin film over it;

c) a polymer matrix containing at least one layer of polymers having different chemical compositions than those used in the fabrication of the device;

d) a polymer matrix composed of three layers of polymers each consisting of a plurality of monomers bonded together by means of cross-linking bonds between them;

e) a polymer matrix comprising a plurality of monomers bound together by covalent bonds forming a network around the periphery of the polymer matrix;

f) a polymer matrix comprised of a plurality of monomers linked by chains of linear units arranged in a chain pattern along the axis of symmetry;

g) a polymer matrix composed of a plurality of monomers connected by non-linear links through interlocking lines connecting the ends of the individual monomer chains;

This makes it very difficult to obtain accurate estimates of magnetism from experimental data. In this paper, we use the technique of non-relativistic quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) to estimate magnetism accurately. We find that QMC simulations provide excellent accuracy for estimating magnetism when compared to experiment.
We also apply the method to the calculation of the magnetic moments of small molecules such as
the rare earth elements.
In addition, we demonstrate that the method can be used to calculate the spin density at low temperatures where there is no need to perform calculations directly.
A new study suggests that the brain’s response to stress may be more sensitive to changes in the environment than previously thought.

Researchers from the University of California San Diego found that people who were exposed to a variety of stressors had lower levels of stress hormones, which could lead to increased stress hormone production.

The researchers looked at how exposure to stress affected the brain’s response to stress. They found that those who experienced greater stress during the day had lower levels of stress hormones, which led to reduced stress hormone production.

“This finding is consistent with previous","Magnetic materials are often characterized by their magnetic susceptibility,
which is defined as the ratio of the magnetic moment of a material to its
magnetic field. The magnetic susceptibility is usually measured at a
temperature where the magnetic moments of the atoms are frozen out.
However, it is possible to measure the magnetic susceptibility of a material
at any temperature below the freezing point. This is because the magnetic
moment of a material is proportional to the temperature. Therefore, one can
measure the magnetic susceptibility of a material without knowing the exact
temperature.
In this paper, we study the magnetic properties of the largest single molecule
magnets. We use the Density Functional Theory (DFT) to calculate the magnetic
structure of the molecules. We then use these magnetic structures to predict
the magnetic susceptibilities of the molecules. Finally, we compare the
predicted magnetic susceptibilities with the experimental data.","The magnetic properties of the largest single molecule magnets are investigated
by means of a magnetic field-induced magnetization measurement. The results show
that the magnetic moments of the large molecules are in the range of
$\sim 10^{12}$ to $10^{13}$ cm$^2$/Vs, with an average value of $\sim
1\times 10^{-3}$ cm$^2$/V. This is comparable to the values reported for
the ground state of the ground state of the first excited state of the
first excited state of the first excited state of the first excited state of
a second excited state of the first excited state of the first excited state of
an intermediate level. These results are consistent with the theoretical
results obtained from the density functional theory calculations. In addition, the
magnetic moment of the small molecules is found to be larger than that of the
largest one. It is also found that the magnetic moments of the small molecules
are smaller than that of the largest one. Finally, the magnetic moments of the
large molecules are found to be larger than that of the smallest one.","The magnetic properties of the largest single molecule magnets are investigated using a combination of first-principles calculations and experimental measurements. The results show that the magnetic properties of the largest single molecule magnets can be described by the spin Hamiltonian, which is derived from the Heisenberg model with the nearest-neighbor exchange interaction between the spins. The calculated magnetic properties are in good agreement with the experimental results.Q:

magnetically driven devices, such as spin valves and tunnel junctions. The GMR
effect has been studied extensively using high quality factor resonant modes at
the nanoscale but it remains unclear how to exploit these features for practical
applications. Here we show experimentally that by combining an external field with
a large number $N$ ($\sim 10^5$), one can significantly enhance both low frequency
and long wavelength components of resonance mode spectra from their respective
zero fields values while keeping them unaffected by each other. We demonstrate this
enhancement through two different mechanisms: firstly via direct coupling between
two distinct types of magnons; secondly due to enhanced scattering cross section
of phonon polaritons which are coupled into higher order harmonic oscillators. Our
results open new avenues towards designing novel functionalities based on topology
in electronic systems where only few degrees of freedom exist. This work also
provides insights about possible applications involving quantum computing or metrology
using nonlinear optical response of mechanical vibrations."

physics,Pursuing complex optical energy through Exceptional Points of Degeneracy (EPDs),"We exploit balancing the complex optical energy between scattering and
guiding states at contrived exceptional points of degeneracy in order to form
an active waveguide without utilizing an active medium. This study reports
peculiar engineering of first-order dispersion on a pseudo-Hermitian
Hamiltonian system in which distributed Bragg grating tracks 0^th order of
scattering phase-shift. This is owing to the EDPs instigated by means of 1D
perturbing PT-symmetries in a planar photonic crystal. The coalescence of Bloch
eigenstates occurs due to reverse amalgamation of modulated two-terminal
optical component whose gain and loss parameters depends on the direction of
the light path. Then, we employed a 1D binary superlattice around a defect that
undergoes both states, physical equilibrium (in the bound layer) and
non-equilibrium (in unbound layer), in chronological order. Then, recoupling
optical energy to the underlying bound region compromises scattering
phase-shift in each sequence. This achievement is not only broadening the
understanding of revolutionized quantum mechanics but also benefits
technological principles of steering localization with high Q-factors that are
in huge demands of designing low-threshold switching, optical tweezers, lasing
and various types of optical elements in photonic integrated circuits.","The EPDs are the most important physical properties of a material. They are fundamental to all living things, and they have been used in many scientific disciplines for thousands of years. The EPDs were first discovered by Einstein in 1868 when he proposed that light could be made from matter without being absorbed by it. He was also able to explain why atoms can't exist at room temperature because their density is too high. In fact, his theory has since become known as the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen principle.

[subtitle14","The EPD approach allows one to study nonlinear optics systems such as
the so-called ""classical"" light source which are coupled via two modes
of propagation. This class includes both classical and quantum mechanical
light sources. The most common type of these devices consists of a
single mode fiber optic cable connected to a pair of mirrors mounted on a
mesh. These fibers are typically made of polypropylene or polycarbonate
materials. The coupling between the two modes is accomplished by means of
a series of linearized waveguides propagating along the length of the
fiber. The resulting system of ordinary differential equations is solved
using the standard Runge-Kutta method. The solution depends on the choice
of the parameters of the problem being studied. For example, the solutions
to the eigenvalue problem may depend on the number of degrees of freedom
of the corresponding matrix elements. The use of different types of matrices
allows us to obtain more accurate results than just solving the original
system without any additional assumptions about how they were constructed.
The main advantage of the EPD approach is that it does not require much
complexity; however, it provides insight into the nature of many fundamental
properties of","The optical properties of materials are often described by the complex dielectric function
which describes the dependence of the refractive index on the frequency of light.
However, the real part of the dielectric function is not directly accessible from
the experimental data. In this work, we use the complex optical energy density
(OEu) which is defined as the real part of the dielectric function. This approach
allows us to access the real part of the dielectric function without the need of
a complex dielectric function. We apply the EPD technique to the study of the
optical response of a two-dimensional photonic crystal slab consisting of
periodic arrays of dielectric rods. The EPD technique allows us to obtain the
real part of the dielectric function at the frequency where the optical
response is maximum. We find that the real part of the dielectric function
decreases monotonically with increasing frequency. Furthermore, we observe that
the real part of the dielectric function exhibits a sharp peak at the frequency
where the optical response is maximum. These results suggest that the optical
response of the photonic crystal slab is dominated by the optical response of
the rods.","We study the problem of extracting a complex optical energy from an
optical signal by using a nonlinear optical system. We consider a
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian system with a single photon, and we show that the
energy is extracted from the state at least once. The extraction process is
controlled by the number of photons in the system, and the resulting spectrum
is characterized by the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. In the limit of
large numbers of photons, the spectral weight of the ground state is given by
the sum of the first two eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian. This result is
applicable to the case where the total angular momentum of the system is
only one photon. Our results are valid for any arbitrary number of photons,
and we show that the EPDs are not only sensitive to the number of photons, but
also to the degree of degeneracy of the states. For example, the maximum
degeneracies of the ground state and excited states are determined by the
number of photons. Furthermore, we show that the spectra of the ground state
are dominated by the second term in the Hamiltonian, which is proportional to
$\sqrt{2}$.","The study of the EPs is a fundamental problem in the field of optics. The EPs are the points where the optical field has a degenerate form, i.e., it is not a linear combination of two orthogonal fields. The EPs have been studied for decades and their properties have been investigated by many researchers. However, the EPs are still under-explored due to the lack of a proper theoretical framework that can be used to describe them. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical framework based on the concept of exceptional points which will be useful for the study of the EPs. We also show how the EPs can be used to design novel optical devices such as optical switches and optical memories. ]{}

We show how these features enable us to realize highly efficient coupling with high quality factors for all modes simultaneously while maintaining low loss rates. Our results are validated using numerical simulations on photonic crystal cavities containing multiple resonant whispering gallery mode microresonators coupled via fiber couplers. In particular we demonstrate strong suppression of spontaneous decay rate inside single cavity resonance condition when compared against conventional approaches based solely on phase matching conditions. This work paves way towards designing robust quantum devices operating under extreme environment conditions where traditional methods fail. It also opens new avenues toward realizing ultrafast optics beyond classical physics. Finally it provides guidance for future applications involving hybrid nanophotonics and metamaterial technology.

physics,Understanding the mesoscopic scaling patterns within cities,"Understanding quantitative relationships between urban elements is crucial
for a wide range of applications. The observation at the macroscopic level
demonstrates that the aggregated urban quantities (e.g., gross domestic
product) scale systematically with population sizes across cities, also known
as urban scaling laws. However, at the mesoscopic level, we lack an
understanding of whether the simple scaling relationship holds within cities,
which is a fundamental question regarding the spatial origin of scaling in
urban systems. Here, by analyzing four extensive datasets covering millions of
mobile phone users and urban facilities, we investigate the scaling phenomena
within cities. We find that the mesoscopic infrastructure volume and
socioeconomic activity scale sub- and super-linearly with the active
population, respectively. For a same scaling phenomenon, however, the exponents
vary in cities of similar population sizes. To explain these empirical
observations, we propose a conceptual framework by considering the
heterogeneous distributions of population and facilities, and the spatial
interactions between them. Analytical and numerical results suggest that,
despite the large number of complexities that influence urban activities, the
simple interaction rules can effectively explain the observed regularity and
heterogeneity in scaling behaviors within cities.","

points: 1) how much more dense it is than what would be expected if there were no
traffic at all; 2) where does the distribution function change when moving away
from one point?
In addition to these three points, our work shows that even though the
population density increases monotonically over time, the spatial scale remains
smaller than predicted by the theory. This suggests that some degree of
scaling occurs between different scales but not across them.
We find that while the size of the scaled populations decreases linearly
with distance from one point, they do not follow any particular pattern until
the next location near the origin. This indicates that although the system moves
away from each other, their relative sizes are still small enough so that most
of the particles move along very similar paths.
This result is consistent with the fact that many systems exhibit large
scale scaling behaviors such as those seen in the case of urban environments.
However, given the nature of the problem studied here, it is likely that only few
systems will experience significant scaling effects due to randomness rather
than being driven by local environmental conditions.
Q:

density of people per square meter. The density of people per square meter
can be described by the number of people per square meter at a certain

of the economic growth of cities. The spatial distribution of urban and rural
population is a key determinant of the economic growth of cities, and it is
important to understand the spatial distribution of urban and rural population
in order to understand the spatial distribution of urban and rural population
within cities. In this paper we study the spatial distribution of urban and
rural population in the city of Shanghai, China. We use data from 2010 to 2020
to investigate the spatial distribution of urban and rural population in the
city of Shanghai. Our results show that the urban population in Shanghai is
larger than that in the city of Shanghai. Moreover, the urban population in
Shanghai is larger than that in the city of Shanghai. These findings suggest
that the spatial distribution of urban and rural population in Shanghai is
more complex than that in the city of Shanghai. This study provides a new
perspective on the spatial distribution of urban and rural population in the
City of Shanghai. It also provides an insight into the spatial distribution of
urban and rural population in Shanghai.","The scaling of the urban area is a fundamental issue in urban planning. The scaling pattern can be described by the fractal dimension, which is defined as the number of scales that are needed to cover the entire area. The fractal dimension has been widely used for analyzing the scaling behavior of the urban area and its relationship with the urban structure. However, the fractal dimension cannot describe the scaling behaviors of the urban area at the mesoscopic scale because the fractal dimension does not take into account the spatial correlation between the different scales. In this paper, we propose a new method to analyze the scaling properties of the urban area based on the concept of the mesoscopic scaling patterns. The proposed method is based on the concept of the mesoscopic scaling patterns (MSPs) introduced by [@MSP]. MSPs are the scaling patterns observed in the urban area when the size of the city is reduced to the order of the mesoscopic scale. We show that the MSPs have an important role in describing the scaling property of the urban area. Furthermore, we discuss how the MSPs can be used to explain the scaling behavior of the urban area from the perspective of the fractal dimension. ]{}

Introduction {#sec:intro}
============","We study how urban systems scale in space and time. We use a network of 1,000s
of nodes to model city-level networks with different levels of complexity: (i) an
arbitrary graph structure; or more specifically we consider graphs that are not
fully connected but have some degree of clustering at each node level. The latter
is motivated by real world data on social interactions between individuals who
are part of groups such as neighborhoods. In this paper, our goal is twofold: i)
to understand what happens when these complex structures emerge from randomness
in nature -- for example they arise naturally during evolution through natural
selection mechanisms - ii) To quantify their impact over various scales ranging
from individual human lives up to global economies. Our results show clear signs
that both spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics play important roles in
urban system formation. Specifically, while spatio-temporal correlations can be
obtained using only few hundred thousand observations per year across all size
scales studied here, it turns out that even if one has access to millions of
individual trajectories spanning decades, there still exists significant power
law behavior which cannot be captured solely based on aggregated statistics."

Additionally, PSMD4 loss in HCC cells suppressed the tumor development in mouse xenograft model. PSMD4, which is maintained by inflammatory factors secreted from tumor matrix cells, positively mediates cell growth and is associated with Akt/GSK-3β/ cyclooxygenase2 (COX2) pathway activation, inhibition of p53 promoter activity, and increased p53 degradation. However, the domain without the C-terminus (VWA+UIM1/2) sustained the activation of p53 transcription. Thus, our findings suggest that PSMD4 is involved in HCC tumor growth through COX2 expression and p53 downregulation. Therapeutic strategies targeting PSMD4 and its downstream effectors could be used for the treatment of PSMD4-abundant HCC patients.","The present study investigated the role of Akt/COX2 pathway in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using a combination of immunohistochemistry and western blotting analysis. The results showed that Akt/COX2 pathway was activated in HCC tissues, and its expression was significantly increased in HCC tissues compared with normal liver tissues. Furthermore, the overexpression of Akt/COX2 pathway promoted the proliferation of HCC cells, and the downregulation of Akt/COx2 pathway inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells. These results suggested that Akt/COx2 pathway may be involved in the development of HCC.Q:

and apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the effects of the PI3K/Akt/p53
(PI3K/Akt/p21) signaling pathway on the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). We found that the PI3K/Akt/p53 signaling pathway promotes the progression
of HCC through the Akt/COX2 pathway. In addition, we found that the p53 inhibitor
pifithrin-alpha (PFTα) inhibits the progression of HCC cells through the Akt/COX2

a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.","BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common malignancy in the United States. The prognosis of HCC is poor, with a 5-year overall survival rate of only 1.5%. Therefore, it is important to identify novel therapeutic targets for HCC. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in HCC progression. This study was conducted using human hepatocytes from patients with HCC. We found that phosphorylated AKT (pAKT), which is a downstream target of p53, was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues compared with normal liver tissue. Furthermore, pAKT was significantly upregulated in HCC cells compared with normal liver tissues. Moreover, pAKT was significantly downregulated in HCC cell lines than in normal liver tissues. These findings suggest that pAKT may be involved in HCC pathogenesis. Our results suggest that pAKT may play an essential role in HCC progression. Further studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanism of pAKT in HCC.
CONCLUSION: PIK3CA is a potential biomarker for predicting HCC progression.","The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is a key regulator of cell growth and survival in cancer cells. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is frequently activated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is associated with poor prognosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in HCC remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in HCC progression using a mouse model of HCC induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN). We found that the expression of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), mTOR, COX2, and cyclin D1 was increased in the liver of DEN-treated mice. Furthermore, the expression of p21 was decreased in the liver of DEN-treated mice. These results suggest that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is activated in HCC and that the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is associated with poor prognosis in patients with HCC.Q:

Full-text contextual searching functionality using Lucene allows the querying of name, synonym, definition, DOID and cross-reference (xrefs) with complex Boolean search strings. The DO semantically integrates disease and medical vocabularies through extensive cross mapping and integration of MeSH, ICD, NCI's thesaurus, SNOMED CT and OMIM disease-specific terms and identifiers. The DO is utilized for disease annotation by major biomedical databases (e.g. Array Express, NIF, IEDB), as a standard representation of human disease in biomedical ontologies (e.g. IDO, Cell line ontology, NIFSTD ontology, Experimental Factor Ontology, Influenza Ontology), and as an ontological cross mappings resource between DO, MeSH and OMIM (e.g. GeneWiki). The DO project (http://diseaseontology.sf.net) has been incorporated into open source tools (e.g. Gene Answers, FunDO) to connect gene and disease biomedical data through the lens of human disease.

Unfortunately, only a few microfilaricidal agents have been approved so far. This study aimed to assess the in vitro macro and microfilaricidal potentialities of the hydro-methanolic extracts of the different powdery fractions of Khaya senegalensis against Onchocerca ochengi.
METHODS: Adult male worms and microfilariae (mf) of O. ochengi were isolated from cowhides in Ngaoundere II, Cameroon. Parasites were incubated for 4 h (mf) or 48 h (adult worms) in RPMI-1640 medium in the presence or absence of ivermectin, flubendazole, or hydro-methanolic extracts of different plant powdery fractions obtained by controlled differential sieving. The filaricidal effect was evaluated using motility (mfs) and mortality tests (worms) and oxidative stress parameters. Cytotoxicity and acute toxicity tests were performed on monkey-derived kidney cell lines (LLC-MK2) and Swiss albino mice, respectively, and selectivity indexes were determined. Phytochemical screening was also carried out using high-performance liquid chromatography/UV (HPLC/UV), molecular networking, and through quantification of phenolic contents.
RESULTS: The hydro-methanolic extracts of 0-63 µm fractions from leaves and barks exhibited the strongest macrofilaricidal activities with lethal concentrations 50 of 162.4 and 208.8 µg/mL respectively versus 22.78 µg/mL for flubendazole. These two fractions also showed the fastest microfilaricidal activities (T

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this single-centre, observational, retrospective study, texture analysis was performed on ADC maps and post-gadolinium T1 images of patients with histological diagnosis of naso-oropharyngeal carcinoma treated with RT-CHT. An initial cohort of 99 patients was selected; 57 of them were later excluded. The final cohort of 42 patients was divided into 3 groups (inflammation, fibrosis, and residual cancer) according to MRI, 18F-FDG-PET/CT performed 3-4 months after RT-CHT, and biopsy. Pre-RT-CHT lesions and the corresponding anatomic area post-RT-CHT were segmented with 3D slicer software from which 107 textural features were derived. T-Student and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed, and features with p-value < 0.01 were considered statistically significant. Cut-off values-obtained by ROC curves-to discriminate post-RT-CHT non-tumoural changes from residual cancer were calculated for the parameters statistically associated to the diseased status at follow-up.
RESULTS: Two features-Energy and Grey Level Non-Uniformity-were statistically significant on T1 images in the comparison between 'positive' (residual cancer) and 'negative' patients (inflammation and fibrosis). Energy was also found to be statistically significant in both patients with fibrosis and residual cancer. Grey Level Non-Uniformity was significant in the differentiation between residual cancer and inflammation. Five features were statistically significant on ADC maps in the differentiation between 'positive' and 'negative' patients. The reduction in values of such features between pre- and post-RT-CHT was correlated with a good response to therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Texture analysis on post-gadolinium T1 images and ADC maps can differentiate residual cancer from fibrosis and inflammation in early follow-up of naso-oropharyngeal carcinoma treated with RT-CHT.","The authors report on their experience with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in naso-oropharyngeal carcinoma (NOPC).

Patients were divided into two groups based on their histopathological characteristics: Group A consisted of patients with a positive tumor marker for CD34+ cells and group B consisted of patients with negative tumor markers for CD34+ cells. We evaluated the response to RT using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), which was used to define the clinical stage of NPC. Clinical data were collected from medical records and pathological slides. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version 20.0. Results: Of the total number of patients, 16 (50%) had a positive tumor marker for CD34+ cells and 8 (25%) had negative tumor markers for CD34+ cells.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of texture analysis in the assessment of response to radiochemotherapy (RCT) in naso-oropharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).

med,Cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation in pediatric patients with cardiac disease: a narrative review.,"Children with cardiac disease are at a higher risk of cardiac arrest as compared to healthy children. Delivering adequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can be challenging due to anatomic characteristics, risk profiles, and physiologies. We aimed to review the physiological aspects of resuscitation in different cardiac physiologies, summarize the current recommendations, provide un update of current literature, and highlight knowledge gaps to guide research efforts. We specifically reviewed current knowledge on resuscitation strategies for high-risk categories of patients including patients with single-ventricle physiology, right-sided lesions, right ventricle restrictive physiology, left-sided lesions, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and arrhythmias. Cardiac arrest occurs in about 1% of hospitalized children with cardiac disease, and in 5% of those admitted to an intensive care unit. Mortality after cardiac arrest in this population remains high, ranging from 30 to 65%. The neurologic outcome varies widely among studies, with a favorable neurologic outcome at discharge observed in 64%-95% of the survivors. Risk factors for cardiac arrest and associated mortality include younger age, lower weight, prematurity, genetic syndrome, single-ventricle physiology, arrhythmias, pulmonary arterial hypertension, comorbidities, mechanical ventilation preceding cardiac arrest, surgical complexity, higher vasoactive-inotropic score, and factors related to resources and institutional characteristics. Recent data suggest that Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation CPR (ECPR) may be a valid strategy in centers with expertise. Overall, knowledge on resuscitation strategies based on physiology remains limited, with a crucial need for further research in this field. Collaborative and interprofessional studies are highly needed to improve care and outcomes for this high-risk population. What is Known: • Children with cardiac disease are at high risk of cardiac arrest, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation may be challenging due to unique characteristics and different physiologies. • Mortality after cardiac arrest remains high and neurologic outcomes suboptimal. What is New: • We reviewed the unique resuscitation challenges, current knowledge, and recommendations for different cardiac physiologies. • We highlighted knowledge gaps to guide research efforts aimed to improve care and outcomes in this high-risk population."," The authors present the results of a systematic review of the literature on the use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in children with cardiac disease. The review was conducted by the American Heart Association, the National Kidney Foundation, and the Pediatric Cardiology Society. The authors reviewed the literature to identify studies that have used CPR as an adjunct therapy for children with cardiac disease. They also reviewed the literature to identify studies that have used CPR as an adjunct therapy for children with acute myocardial infarction or chronic heart failure. The authors concluded that there is no evidence that CPR can be used alone in this population. However, they noted that it may be useful in some populations where other interventions are not available. The authors conclude that although many trials were published comparing CPR to other therapies, there is still insufficient evidence to support the use of CPR in these populations. The authors suggest that further research is needed to determine the optimal duration of CPR before initiating CPR.Q:

ERROR 1064 (42000","Cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation are common events in children
with heart failure who require intensive care unit (ICU) support. Cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPRS) is often performed during ICU admission. This procedure
can result in significant morbidity and mortality. A number of studies have
shown that CPIRS results in increased mortality and morbidity compared to
cardiac arrest alone. However, there are no published studies comparing
the effects of CPIRS on survival in children with cardiac disease.
In this article, we present a narrative review of the literature regarding
carcinogenic mechanisms associated with CPIRS. We discuss the potential
benefits of CPIRS when used in clinical practice.

A total of 521 patients were included in this study. Patients with cardiac arrest were older than those without CA (mean age, 69 [SD, 14] years; 95 [SD, 13] years; P < 0.001), had higher body mass index (BMI), lower ejection fraction (EF), and higher left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (P = 0.002). There was no significant difference in the incidence of cardiac arrest among the three groups. Cardiovascular deaths occurred in 4% of patients with cardiac arrest and in 2% of patients without cardiac arrest.

med,Epinephrine injection monotherapy shows similar hemostatic efficacy to epinephrine injection combined therapy in high-risk patients (Forrest Ib) with bleeding ulcers.,"BACKGROUND: Whether combination therapy has higher hemostatic efficacy than epinephrine injection monotherapy in different Forrest classifications is not clear. This study aimed to compare hemostatic efficacy between epinephrine injection monotherapy (MT) and combination therapy (CT) based on different Forrest classifications.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB) patients who underwent endoscopic epinephrine injections or epinephrine injections combined with a second therapy between March 2014 and June 2022 in our center, and the patients were divided into MT group or CT group. Subsequently, a propensity score matching analysis (PSM) was performed and rebleeding rates were calculated according to Forrest classifications via a stratified analysis.
RESULTS: Overall, 605 patients who met the inclusion criteria were included, and after PSM, 173 patients in each of the CT and MT groups were included. For PUB patients with nonbleeding visible vessels (FIIa), the rebleeding rates by Days 3, 7, 14, and 30 after PSM were 8.8%, 17.5%, 19.3%, and 19.3% in the MT group, respectively, and rates were 0%, 4.1%, 5.5%, and 5.5% in the CT group, respectively, with significant differences observed between the two groups by Days 3, 7, 14, and 30 (P = 0.015, P = 0.011, P = 0.014, and P = 0.014, respectively). However, for PUB patients with oozing bleeding (FIb), the rebleeding rates by Days 3, 7, 14, and 30 after PSM were 14.9%, 16.2%, 17.6%, and 17.6% in the MT group, respectively, and rates were 13.2%, 14.7%, 14.7%, and 16.2% in the CT group, respectively, with no significant differences observed between the two groups by Days 3, 7, 14, and 30 (P = 0.78, P = 0.804, P = 0.644 and P = 0.825).

med,The correlations between C-reactive protein and MRI-detected inflammation in patients with axial spondyloarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are widely used to monitor inflammation in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), but the relationship between CRP and MRI-detected inflammation is incompletely understood. The present study was undertaken to assess correlations between CRP and MRI-detected inflammation in axSpA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed (Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library) to identify relevant studies concerning CRP and MRI-detected inflammation in axSpA patients. The MRI-detected inflammation was evaluated by MRI-based disease activity score (DAS). The correlation between CRP and MRI-based DAS was integrated by random-effect models.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies reported a total of 1392 axSpA patients which were included in this meta-analysis. CRP was significantly associated with spinal MR DAS (r=0.226, 95%CI [0.149, 0.291], p<0.001, I
CONCLUSIONS: In axSpA patients, CRP is associated with MRI-detected inflammation in the spine but not in SIJ. We speculate that CRP could be a reasonable index to reflect spinal inflammation. Therefore, we suggest it is not essential to repeat spinal MRI in a short term, while SIJ MRI may be necessary to provide additional information on inflammation. Key Points • CRP is associated with MRI-detected inflammation in the spine but not in sacroiliac joints. • CRP at baseline was negatively associated with improvement in spinal MR DAS. • It was not essential to repeat spinal MRI frequently, while SIJ MRI may be necessary to provide additional information on inflammation."," The correlation between C-reactive protein (CRP) and MRI-detected inflammation in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (ASA) is not well established.

In addition, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the effect of CRP on MRI-detected inflammation in ASAs. We found that there was no significant difference in the risk of MRI-detected inflammation between patients with and without CRP. However, when we compared the risk of MRI-detected inflammation between patients with and without CRP, we found that patients with CRP had a significantly higher risk of MRI-detected inflammation than those without CRP. Furthermore, we found that patients with CRP had a significantly lower risk of MRI-detected inflammation than those without CRP.

Introduction
============

The use of robotic devices for colectomy has been increasing rapidly over the last decade, but there is still no consensus regarding the optimal technique for this procedure. In particular, it is not clear whether the surgeon should use a robotic device to perform colectomy or a laparoscopic device to perform colectomy.

The current standard approach for performing colectomy is using a robotic instrument that can be used to perform both procedures. However, these instruments are limited in their ability to provide precise surgical guidance during colectomy. This limitation may result from the fact that surgeons have difficulty understanding the anatomy of the patient's body when performing colectomy.

In this paper, we present a comparative study of two types of robotically assisted colectomy (RACO) performed by a pediatrician who was trained in robotics. We also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of RACO compared to other techniques such as laparoscopy and laparotomy.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients who underwent colectomy at","The Robotic-assisted Colectomy (RAAC) procedure involves removing a child's
pelvis from the abdomen during laparoscopic surgery. This procedure is performed
by placing a small amount of tissue between the pelvis and the iliac crest.
The surgeon inserts a small amount of tissue through the abdominal wall at one
side of the pelvis and over the umbilicus. After removal of the patient, the
surgeon removes the remaining tissue from the pelvic cavity. The surgeon then
receives the tumor removed from the body via the umbilicus. The surgeon may
also remove the residual tumor after resection of the tumor. The surgeon typically
uses a robotic device to remove the residual tumor while performing the
robotic procedure. The surgeon uses a robotic device to remove the residual tumor
from the body via the umbilicus. The robotically assisted procedure includes
a laparoscopy followed by a robotic instrumentation technique.

med,An overview of meta-analyses on radiomics: more evidence is needed to support clinical translation.,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct an overview of meta-analyses of radiomics studies assessing their study quality and evidence level.
METHODS: A systematical search was updated via peer-reviewed electronic databases, preprint servers, and systematic review protocol registers until 15 November 2022. Systematic reviews with meta-analysis of primary radiomics studies were included. Their reporting transparency, methodological quality, and risk of bias were assessed by PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 checklist, AMSTAR-2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews, version 2) tool, and ROBIS (Risk Of Bias In Systematic reviews) tool, respectively. The evidence level supporting the radiomics for clinical use was rated.
RESULTS: We identified 44 systematic reviews with meta-analyses on radiomics research. The mean ± standard deviation of PRISMA adherence rate was 65 ± 9%. The AMSTAR-2 tool rated 5 and 39 systematic reviews as low and critically low confidence, respectively. The ROBIS assessment resulted low, unclear and high risk in 5, 11, and 28 systematic reviews, respectively. We reperformed 53 meta-analyses in 38 included systematic reviews. There were 3, 7, and 43 meta-analyses rated as convincing, highly suggestive, and weak levels of evidence, respectively. The convincing level of evidence was rated in (1) T2-FLAIR radiomics for IDH-mutant vs IDH-wide type differentiation in low-grade glioma, (2) CT radiomics for COVID-19 vs other viral pneumonia differentiation, and (3) MRI radiomics for high-grade glioma vs brain metastasis differentiation.
CONCLUSIONS: The systematic reviews on radiomics were with suboptimal quality. A limited number of radiomics approaches were supported by convincing level of evidence.

results show that meta-analysis is a useful tool for clinical translational
research, but it is not always available in the scientific community. This
paper presents a systematic review of the literature on meta-analysis. It
provides a comprehensive description of the available evidence on meta-analysis
for clinical translational research. A summary of the available evidence is
provided along with a brief discussion of the limitations of the existing
literature. Finally, we discuss some possible directions for further
development of meta-analysis. Overall, our results suggest that meta-analysis
is a valuable tool for clinical translational research, but it is not always
available in the scientific community.","Meta-analysis has been used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities for breast cancer, but its use in clinical practice is limited by the lack of high-quality evidence. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of radiomics in breast cancer. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar from inception to April 2018. We included studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of radiomics in breast cancer using at least one of the following criteria: (1) quantitative analysis of radiomic features; (2) comparison with histopathology or other reference standard; (3) validation study; (4) prospective cohort study; and (5) retrospective cohort study. The quality of each study was assessed using QUADAS-2. We identified 10 eligible studies involving 2,827 patients. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78-0.88) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.77-0.88), respectively. The pooled positive likelihood ratio was 6.7 (95% CI, 4.9-8.6). The pooled negative likelihood","Meta-analysis (MA) has become a standard tool for evaluating the effectiveness and safety of new treatments in medicine, but it remains underused by clinicians due to its complexity and time consuming nature. In this review we provide an outline of MA methods that are currently used across various disciplines including radiology; however there still exists limited guidance regarding how these techniques should be applied within each discipline when conducting MAs. We also discuss potential future directions with regard to developing standards or guidelines related to using different types of data sets as well as performing multiple analyses per study design. Finally, our aim was to highlight areas where further research could improve current practices while providing direction towards improving patient care through improved use of existing tools such as MRMSEs. This article represents one part of The Frontiers Collection's mission to advance medical imaging science via collaboration between researchers from around the world who share common interests in image analysis methodologies. It provides readership insight into what they can do themselves if given access to high quality datasets containing both quantitative features extracted directly from images and qualitative ones derived indirectly from them. By combining their expertise together, scientists will have greater opportunities to develop novel algorithms which may lead to better diagnosis and treatment strategies."

We present a case of IML in a patient with VEXAS syndrome who was diagnosed with LM. A review of the literature revealed that LM is a rare but potentially life-threatening disease, and LM is often misdiagnosed as an autoimmune disorder. In addition, LM is often misidentified as a benign disease, and LM is often misclassified as a malignant disease. Therefore, it is important to identify patients with LM who are at risk for developing LM. This study aimed to identify patients with suspected LM who were diagnosed with LM and to determine their diagnostic criteria.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Among all patients with suspected LM, we identified a total of 762 patients with suspected LM who were diagnosed with LM. Of these, 561 patients were diagnosed with LM, including 463 with LM and 621 with other diagnoses. Patients with LM had a higher rate of comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding age, sex, and comorbidity status.","[Vexas syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the presence of multiple cutaneous and visceral lesions, including skin lesions, skeletal abnormalities, and cardiac anomalies.

med,Efficacy and safety of different PD-1 inhibitors in combination with lenvatinib in the treatment of unresectable primary liver cancer: a multicentre retrospective study.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are safe and efficacious treatments for advanced primary liver cancer (PLC). The efficacy of different ICIs in the treatment of liver cancer remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore whether there is a difference in the efficacy and safety of various programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors in combination with lenvatinib in the treatment of unresectable PLC. Patients with PLC treated with lenvatinib in combination with PD-1 inhibitors (camrelizumab, tislelizumab, sintilimab, or pembrolizumab) between January 2018 and December 2021 were retrospectively enrolled. Tumor response, adverse events, and grades were evaluated. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test were used to compare the overall survival and progression-free survival of patients treated with different PD-1 inhibitors. Cox regression analysis was used for univariate and multivariate analyses to identify clinical variables related to treatment efficacy. This study included a total of 176 patients who received a combination of lenvatinib and PD-1 inhibitors. Of these, 103 patients received camrelizumab, 44 received tislelizumab, 20 received sintilimab, and 9 received pembrolizumab. There was no significant difference in the pairwise comparison of camrelizumab, tislelizumab, sintilimab, and pembrolizumab using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Adverse events occurred in 40 (22.7%) patients (grade ≥ 3, 2.3%). The incidence of grade 3 adverse events among the four PD-1 inhibitor groups was below 5%. Camrelizumab, tislelizumab, sintilimab, and pembrolizumab are viable options for patients with unresectable PLC. These PD-1 inhibitors in combination with lenvatinib showed good safety profiles.

liver cancer who have received prior chemotherapy. Lenvatinib is approved for the treatment of
liver cancer based on clinical trials showing significant reductions in overall
survival rates compared to placebo. Lenvatinib is available in two forms:
(i) a single oral dose of 5 mg/kg twice daily; and (ii) a single oral dose of 20 mg/kg once daily.
The former is given orally at a dosage of 1 mg/kg twice daily. The latter is given intravenously at a dosage of 20 mg/kg every 3 weeks.

med,Rapid and sensitive detection of E. coli O157:H7 by lateral flow immunoassay and silver enhancement.,"The aim of this study was to develop a sensitive lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) for the rapid detection of Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7, a pathogen contributor to diseases and fatalities worldwide. Au nanoparticles with high stability, uniform size, and shape were synthesized and coated with heterobifunctional PEG polymer with carboxyl groups, and they were bioconjugated to be used as label in sandwich-LFIA. Then, a silver enhancement strategy was developed as an accessible, rapid, and cost-effective approach for signal amplification to reduce the limit of detection (LOD). The optimal results were achieved when a solution of silver nitrate and hydroquinone/citrate buffer was added to the strips for 4 min. This led to a decrease in the visual LOD from 2 × 10","The rapid and sensitive detection of E. coli O157:H7 by lateral flow immunoassay and silver enhancement is described here. The assay was performed on a 96-well plate with a 1.5-mL volume containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% BSA/0.01% Tween 80, pH 7.4. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 2 h in the dark. After washing three times with PBS, the wells were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h before being washed three times with PBS to remove non-specific binding sites. Then, the wells were incubated with the anti-E. coli O157:H7 antibody diluted 1:200 in PBS overnight at 4°C followed by an additional wash step with PBS. Finally, the wells were stained with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DABCO) solution as previously described [@pone.0049072-Kawaguchi1].

====","The rapid and sensitive detection of E. coli O157:H7 by lateral flow immunoassay and Silver enhancement are two key steps in the
development of a new class of diagnostic tests for bacterial pathogens. These assays
are based on the use of antibodies against bacteria which bind to cells at their
surface receptors. This assay uses antibody binding sites located on cell surface
receptors such as cytoplasmic proteins and nucleic acids. The sensitivity of these
antibody binding sites depends on the concentration of antigen bound to each receptor
in the sample being tested. The specificity of the assay depends on the amount of
antibody bound to the receptor so it is not possible to determine if there is any
difference between the concentrations of antigens bound to different receptors than
the one found when they are measured. The sensitivity of the assay depends on the
amount of protein bound to the receptor but does not depend on the number of
antibodies available per molecule. The sensitivity of the assay depends on the
number of molecules required to detect specific epitopes within the target organism.
The sensitivity of the assay depends on the size of the target organisms involved.
The sensitivity of the assay depends on the type of enzyme","The detection of foodborne pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 is one of the most challenging tasks in food safety management. The rapid and sensitive detection of E. coli O157:H7 requires the development of a rapid and sensitive lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) test kit. The LFA test kit developed in this study uses a lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) technique based on the principle of the sandwich immunoassay. The LFA test kit is capable of detecting E. coli O157:H7 at the level of 10 CFU/mL within 30 min. The LFA test kit is highly sensitive and specific, and can detect E. coli O157:H7 at the level of 10 CFU/mL even when the concentration of E. coli O157:H7 is less than 10 CFU/mL. The LFA test kit is simple, easy to operate, and cost effective. It is expected that the LFA test kit will be widely used in the food industry.","The rapid and sensitive detection of E. coli O157:H7 in blood samples has been a major focus of the recent years. However, the sensitivity of the assay is limited by the high background level of E. coli O157:H7 in blood samples. In this study, we developed an automated method for the rapid and sensitive detection of E. coli O157:H7 in blood samples using a novel immunochromatographic platform based on the Agilent Technologies software package (Agile-X). The Agilent Microbiome Software was used to develop the Agilent microfluidic chip that was able to detect E. coli O157:H7 in blood samples. We evaluated the performance of our method on two different blood samples from patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute kidney injury (AKI), respectively. Our results showed that the Agilent technology could detect E. coli O157:H7 in blood samples with a sensitivity of 0.8% and a specificity of 100%. This method can be applied to the routine diagnosis of ARDS and AKI. Furthermore, it can be used as a tool for the rapid and sensitive detection of E. coli O157:H7 in blood samples.","The rapid and sensitive detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7 by lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) and silver enhancement was developed. The LFI system is based on the principle that the antibody-coated strip can be used to detect the target bacteria in a sample, which is then visualized with a colorimetric reagent. The LFI assay has been applied to the detection of E. coli O157:H7 in food samples from different sources. The results showed that the LFI method could detect E. coli O157:H7 at a concentration as low as 10 CFU/mL. The LFI test also exhibited good specificity for E. coli O157:H7. The sensitivity of the LFI test was improved by using a silver enhancement reagent. The LFI test had a detection limit of 10 CFU/mL and a linear range of 10(1)-10(5) CFU/mL.

med,Application of Behavioral Tests for Evaluation of an Experimental Model of Alzheimer's Disease in Female Rats.,"Alzheimer's disease was modeled in female Wistar rats aged 4 months by stereotaxic bilateral injection of a synthetic peptide β-amyloid (Aβ1-42) into the hippocampus. Behavioral tests (open field, Y-maze, passive avoidance, and Morris water maze) revealed significant impairment of memory and spatial navigation 8 weeks after β-amyloid administration. At this term, the cognitive impairments typical of Alzheimer's disease are reproduced. The experimental model of Alzheimer's disease proposed by us can be used in preclinical studies of drugs for the treatment of this pathology.","The behavioral tests were designed to evaluate the effects of a single dose of a drug on memory, learning and memory function (see [@bib0155]). The results showed that the doses used had no effect on any memory functions or performance parameters. However, the drugs did have some effects on cognitive functions such as working memory which was not affected by the doses used. The authors concluded that the use of a single dose of a drug does not affect cognition but rather affects behavior because it is more effective at improving motor skills than other methods.

------------

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories) were purchased from Charles River Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Langfeng, China). All animals were housed in groups of five per cage with food and water *ad libitum*. They were maintained under standard laboratory conditions including 12 h light/dark cycle, humidity of 50% and temperature of 22--24 °C. All experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for animal experimentation ([www.nih.gov/nih.html","The behavioral tests are based on the assumption that animals do not exhibit any
behavioral abnormalities when exposed to environmental stimuli. This hypothesis
was tested experimentally at the University of California, San Diego, where it was found
that rats treated with a high dose of ethanol showed no signs of memory impairment.
The authors concluded that these results were consistent with previous studies
of alcoholics who exhibited some degree of memory impairment but did not exhibit
any behavior abnormality.
In addition, the authors noted that they could not find any evidence that
alcoholics had impaired performance during the test.
The authors further suggested that there may be other factors which might
have contributed to the observed effects. For example, one study reported that
the administration of ethanol resulted in increased levels of brain norepinephrine
in the hippocampus; however, the authors failed to observe any changes in
norepinephrine levels in the hippocampus after treatment.
The authors proposed that the effect of ethanol exposure on hippocampal function
may be due to alterations in the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine
and noradrenaline.
The authors conclude that the findings from the current study provide strong
evidence that ethanol exposure does not affect cognition in humans.
Q:
","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive impairment. The etiology of AD is still unknown, but it is believed that genetic factors play a major role. The most common type of AD is the sporadic form, which is caused by the accumulation of amyloid beta peptide (Aβ). Aβ is a small protein composed of 39 amino acids; however, there are many different types of Aβ species depending on the source of the material from which they were produced. The main forms of Aβ found in the brain are Aβ40 and Aβ42. These two isoforms differ only in their N-terminal region. Aβ40 is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by proteolytic cleavage at the β-secretase site, while Aβ42 is derived from the APP by a non-cleavaged mechanism. Aβ40 and Aβ42 are both toxic to neurons, and thus contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.
In this study, we developed a behavioral test system based on the Morris water maze (MWM) paradigm to evaluate the effects of Aβ40 and Aβ42 on learning and memory functions in female rats.","BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the behavioral effects of a novel experimental model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in female rats. This model is a model of AD that has been used to investigate the relationship between AD and cognitive decline. We used behavioral tests to assess the effects of AD on the behavior of male rats. In addition, we evaluated the effects of AD on the behavioral effects of male rats on the behavior of females. Results: Compared with the control group, the AD group showed significantly higher levels of anxiety, depression, and fearfulness. However, the AD group showed significantly lower levels of anxiety, depression, and fearfulness. Moreover, the AD group showed significantly lower levels of anxiety, depression, and fearfulness. These results suggest that AD may be associated with behavioral changes in female rats. Further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between AD and behavioral changes in female rats.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that AD may have a significant effect on the behavioral changes of female rats. Therefore, AD may be associated with behavioral changes in female rats. Future research should focus on the relationship between AD and behavioral changes in female rats. Furthermore, AD may be associated with behavioral changes in female rats.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a new experimental model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in female rats, which is based on the administration of amyloid beta peptide (Aβ1-42) and the use of behavioral tests. The animals were divided into three groups: control group (n = 10), Aβ1-42 group (n = 10), and Aβ1-42 + L-DOPA group (n = 10). The behavioral tests were performed at the age of 6 months. The results showed that the Aβ1-42 group had a significant decrease in memory performance compared with the control group. In addition, the Aβ1-42 + L-DOPA group showed a significant increase in memory performance compared with the Aβ1-42 group. These results suggest that the Aβ1-42 treatment can be used as a model of AD in female rats.Q:

This research was conducted at Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge from May 2022 until December 2021. In this paper we describe how behavioral tests were applied during preclinical development of F-AD models using male Wistar albino mice as test subjects. We also present results obtained by analyzing data collected after administration of different doses of Aβ1-42 peptide into both groups of animals. Results indicate that our novel animal disease modeling approach can be used successfully to investigate potential therapeutic agents against amyloid β deposition in vivo. Furthermore, it has been shown that treatment with low dose of recombinant mouse interleukin 1 beta reduces cognitive deficits induced by intracerebroventricular injection of oligomeric forms of α-synuclein protein in transgenic PDAPP/PSEN1dE9 double mutant mice. These findings suggest that IL-1β may have beneficial effects on motor function and cognition through reduction of neuronal inflammation associated with synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's diseases or Lewy body dementia."
med,"The RNA-Binding Proteins OAS1, ZFP36L2, and DHX58 Are Involved in the Regulation of CD44 mRNA Splicing in Colorectal Cancer Cells.","Regulation of alternative splicing is carried out by RNA-binding proteins. Each alternative splicing event is controlled by several RNA-binding proteins, which in combination create the distribution of alternative splicing products in a given cell type. Transmembrane protein CD44 plays an important role at various stages of the metastatic cascade and is considered as a promising molecule for the therapy of tumor diseases and the construction of prognostic classifiers. However, the functions of specific isoforms of this protein may differ significantly. In this work, we performed a bioinformatic search of RNA-binding proteins that can determine the expression of clinically significant isoforms 3 and 4 of CD44 protein. The analysis revealed five RNA-binding proteins, three of which (OAS1, ZFP36L2, and DHX58) are shown for the first time as potential regulators of the studied process.","The RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are a family of small GTPases that bind to the RNA-binding domain of the RNA-binding protein (RBP) and regulate its splicing. The RBP is involved in the regulation of the splicing of the target mRNA by binding to the RNA-binding domain of RBP. In this study, we investigated the role of the RBP in the regulation of the splicing of the target mRNA in colorectal cancer cells. We found that the RBP interacts with the RNA-binding domain of RBP and regulates its splicing. We also showed that the RBP can bind to the RNA-binding domain of RBP and regulate its splicing. These results suggest that the RBP plays a role in the regulation of the splicing of the target mRNA through the regulation of the splicing of the target mRNA.Q:

survival rates of patients with CC are very poor due to the high incidence of
the disease. The molecular mechanisms underlying the development of CC remain
unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the RNA-binding

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the expression of the spliceosome protein BIRC5 (also known as CENP-A) is involved in regulating the expression of CD44 mRNA splicing in colorectal cancer cells. We found that the expression of BRC5 was significantly increased in colon cancer cells compared with normal colon epithelial cells. Furthermore, the expression of BIRC5 was significantly decreased in colorectal cancer cells when treated by miR171 inhibitor or siRNA. These results suggest that BIRC5 may be involved in the regulation of CD44 splicing in colorectal cancer cells. Our findings provide new insights into the role of BIRC5 in regulating the expression of CD44 mRNA splicing in colorectal cancer cells. This study provides a novel insight into the role of BIRC5 in regulating the expression of CD44 mRNA splicing in colorectal cancer cells. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism of BIRC5 in regulating the expression of CD44 mRNA splicing in colorectal cancer cells.","The RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) OAS1, ZFP36L2, and DHX58 are involved in the regulation of CD44 mRNA splicing in colorectal cancer cells.

med,The association of normal-range serum phosphorus with immunoglobulin A nephropathy progression: a retrospective cohort study.,"PURPOSE: The relationship between serum phosphorus and immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy progression remains uncertain, especially normal-range serum phosphorus. Therefore, we herein examined the relationship between the normal-range serum phosphorus and the progression of IgA nephropathy.
METHODS: One hundred sixty-two patients with primary IgA nephropathy were divided into three groups according to tertiles of baseline serum phosphorus (first tertile: 0.73-1.04 mmol/L; second tertile: 1.04-1.21 mmol/L; third tertile: 1.21-1.60 mmol/L). Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration. The composite outcome was defined as a decrease of at least 50% in eGFR from baseline or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The association of serum phosphorus with IgA nephropathy progression was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for potential confounders.
RESULTS: During a median 16 month follow-up period, 15 patients reached a composite outcome. In the crude Cox proportional hazard model, baseline serum phosphorus as a continuous variable was associated with increased risk for adverse renal outcomes [hazard ratio (HR) = 63.510, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.953-1020.284, P = 0.003], and the high tertile of serum phosphorus group had an increased risk of the composite outcome by using the low tertile group as the reference (HR = 11.895, 95% CI = 1.522-92.993, P = 0.018). After adjustment for traditional risk factors, the high tertile of serum phosphorus group was significantly related to IgA nephropathy progression compared with the low tertile group (HR = 9.424, 95% CI = 1.019-87.165, P = 0.048).
CONCLUSIONS: Relatively higher serum phosphorus levels within the normal range were significantly associated with the progression of IgA nephropathy.","The association between normal-range serum phosphorus and the development of IgA nephropathy is not well established. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between normal-range serum phosphorus and the development of IgA nephropathy in a cohort of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We retrospectively analyzed the data of all patients who underwent renal biopsy at our institution between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2012. Serum phosphorus levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Patients' characteristics are shown in [table 1](#T1){ref-type=""table""}. The mean age was 63.5 years (range 41-85 years). There were no significant differences in sex, body mass index (BMI), or smoking status between the groups. In addition, there were no significant differences in the number of patients with IgA nephropathy among the groups. The prevalence of IgA nephropathy was significantly higher in patients with CKD than in those without it (P = 0.001). However, there were no significant differences in the incidence of IgA nephropathy among the groups. The results suggest that normal-range serum phosphorus may be an independent predictor of the development of Ig","The relationship between serum phosphorus concentration and disease severity may
be related to changes in the distribution of serum phosphorus concentrations
in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Serum phosphorus levels are
associated with various diseases such as renal failure, diabetes, obesity,
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Serum phosphorus
levels correlate well with clinical parameters such as albuminuria, proteinuria,
creatinine clearance, and blood pressure. Serum phosphorus levels were found to
have significant associations with CKD stages I, II, III, IV, and V. Serum phosphorus
levels correlated positively with age, sex, body mass index, and total cholesterol
levels. Serum phosphorus levels had no effect on mortality rates. Serum phosphorus
levels did not affect survival rates. Serum phosphorus levels do not appear to
change over time when taking into account other factors such as dietary intake,
age, and smoking. Serum phosphorus levels remained elevated after adjusting for
these confounding variables. Serum phosphorus levels showed little change from
before until now. Serum phosphorus levels increased during the follow-up period
of 2 years. Serum phosphorus levels decreased more than 1 year after adjusting
for these additional confound","Serum phosphorus (SP) is one of the most commonly measured laboratory parameters
in clinical practice. It is widely used as a marker of kidney function and
renal disease. SP is mainly derived from the measurement of serum creatinine
(SCr). However, SCr is not always available at the time of diagnosis due to
the presence of other causes of renal dysfunction. Therefore, it is necessary
to measure SP before initiating treatment. This study aimed to investigate the
association between SP levels and the development of IgA nephropathy (IgAN).
This retrospective cohort study included patients who were diagnosed with
either IgAN or non-nephrotic proteinuria based on the criteria of the
International Study Group on Kidney Disease in Children (ISGKDC). The
following variables were collected: age, gender, body mass index (BMI),
serum creatinine (SCr), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR),
immunoglobulin A (IgA), and total cholesterol (TC). The primary outcome was
the development of IgAN. Secondary outcomes were the development of
nephrocalcinosis, hypertension, and proteinuria.","BACKGROUND AND METHODS: We aimed to investigate the association between serum phosphorus (SP) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (INP). This was a prospective, observational cohort study. The primary outcome was INP. Secondary outcomes were serum SP and IgA nephropathy progression. Patients were divided into two groups based on their serum levels of SP: those who had high SP (≥ 200 mg/dl), those who had low SP (less than 200 mg/dl), or those who did not have high SP (no SP). In addition, we compared the associations between serum SP and IgA nephropathy progression in patients with different levels of SP.
METHODS: Data from this study were retrospectively collected from all patients who underwent kidney transplantation at our center between January 1st, 2020 and December 31st, 2021. Serum concentrations of SP were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. All patients were followed up for INP. For each patient, serum concentration of SP was calculated by dividing the mean serum level of SP by that of IgA. Then, the association between serum SP and INP was analyzed using logistic regression."," The aim of this study was to investigate the association between serum phosphorus (P) and IgA nephropathy (IgAN) progression in patients with normal P levels. We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients with normal P levels who were followed up for IgAN at our hospital from January 2010 to December 2016. The primary endpoint was the rate of IgAN progression, defined as the time interval between the first visit and the last visit or the time of renal biopsy. The secondary endpoints were the rates of proteinuria, hematuria, and hypertension. Of the 583 patients with normal P levels, we identified 51 patients with IgAN progression during follow-up. The median age was 61 years old; the male/female ratio was 1.6 : 1. The median follow-up period was 4.5 years. The median time interval between the first visit and the last visit was 2.0 years. The median time interval between the first visit and the date of renal biopsy was 3.0 years. The median time interval between the first visit and the date of death was 6.0 years. The median time interval between the first visit and the date of dialysis initiation was 7.0 years. The median time interval between the first","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Normal range (NR) for the level of phosphate in blood is defined as 2.5 to 5.0 mg/dL, and it has been reported that patients who have high levels of phosphorous may progress into IgA glomerulopathy or end stage renal disease (ESRD). However, there are few studies on whether abnormal values of PTH can predict ESRD progression. We aimed to investigate this issue by retrospectively analyzing data from our hospital's database between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2019. This was an observational single center study using electronic medical records. The primary outcome variable was ESRD progression; secondary outcomes were death due to kidney failure, dialysis initiation, transplantation, acute rejection episodes, chronic graft dysfunction, malignancy recurrence, infection relapse, sepsis, stroke, cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, heart attack, arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, cardiac arrest, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, respiratory insufficiency, etc., which occurred during follow up period."

med,Infectious profiles in civilian gunshot associated long bone fractures.,"PURPOSE: There is a paucity of literature on infections in civilian gunshot associated with long bone fractures with the reported rates ranging from 0-15.7%.This study aimed to investigate the rates of infection associated with long bone fractures caused by civilian gunshots. The specific objectives were to determine if certain extremities were at a higher risk for infection and to identify the types of bacteria present in these infections by analyzing culture isolates.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of consecutive patients aged 18-64 who sustained gunshot-associated long bone fractures at an urban Level I trauma centre from 2010 to 2017. Patient selection was based done through a institutional trauma centre database using international classification of diseases (ICD) 9 and 10 codes. We included patients who underwent surgical treatment, specifically fracture fixation, at our institution and excluded patients with fractures involving the pelvis, spine, foot, and hand. A total of 384 gunshot-associated long bone fractures in 347 patients were identified for analysis. Relevant patient-, injury-, and treatment-related variables were extracted from clinical records and radiographic reviews. Outcomes of interest included bony union, repeat operative procedures, and the development of deep infection.
RESULTS: 347 patients with 384 long bone fractures were included. 32 fractures in 32 patients developed an infection for an incidence of 9.3% of patients and 8.3% of fractures. Gram-positive bacteria were present in 23/32 (72.0%) culture isolates, gram-negative bacteria in 10/32 (31.3%) culture isolates, and six infections were polymicrobial. Staphylococcus 16/32 (50.0%) and Enterobacter 6/32 (18.8%) species were the most common isolates. Of the Staphylococcus species, 5/16 (31.3%) were MRSA. Lower extremity fractures had a greater risk for infection compared to the upper extremity (11.7% vs 3.7% p < 0.01) and fractures that developed an infection had a larger average zone of comminution (63.9 mm vs 48.5 mm p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study investigated the rates of infection associated with long bone fractures caused by civilian gunshots. The overall infection rate observed in our series aligns with existing literature. Gram-positive bacteria were the predominant isolates, with a notable incidence of MRSA in our patient population, highlighting the need for considering empiric coverage. Additionally, gram-negative organisms were found in a significant proportion of infections, and a notable percentage of infections were polymicrobial. Our findings emphasize the importance of carefully assessing highly comminuted lower extremity fractures and implementing appropriate antibiotic coverage and operative debridement for patients with gunshot-related long bone fractures. While current prophylaxis algorithms for open fractures lack specific inclusion of gunshot wounds, we propose incorporating these injuries to reduce the incidence of infections associated with such fractures.","The author of the article is a former member of the American Academy of Pediatrics, and has been working on this issue for over 20 years.

med,Competitive dual-strain SIS epidemiological models with awareness programs in heterogeneous networks: two modeling approaches.,"Epidemic diseases and media campaigns are closely associated with each other. Considering most epidemics have multiple pathogenic strains, in this paper, we take the lead in proposing two multi-strain SIS epidemic models in heterogeneous networks incorporating awareness programs due to media. For the first model, we assume that the transmission rates for strain 1 and strain 2 depend on the level of awareness campaigns. For the second one, we further suppose that awareness divides susceptible population into two different subclasses. After defining the basic reproductive numbers for the whole model and each strain, we obtain the analytical conditions that determine the extinction, coexistence and absolute dominance of two strains. Moreover, we also formulate its optimal control problem and identify an optimal implementation pair of awareness campaigns using optimal control theory. Given the complexity of the second model, we use the numerical simulations to visualize its different types of dynamical behaviors. Through theoretical and numerical analysis of these two models, we discover some new phenomena. For example, during the persistence analysis of the first model, we find that the characteristic polynomials of two boundary equilibria may have a pair of pure imaginary roots, implying that Hopf bifurcation and periodic solutions may appear. Most strikingly, multistability occurs in the second model and the growth rate of awareness programs (triggered by the infection prevalence) has a multistage impact on the final size of two strains. The numerical results suggest that the spread of a two-strain epidemic can be controlled (even be eradicated) by taking the measures of enhancing awareness transmission, reducing memory fading of aware individuals and ensuring high-level influx and rapid growth of awareness programs appropriately.","This paper presents a novel approach to the study of the prevalence and incidence of SIS, which is based on the use of a multi-strain model for each individual's risk profile. The main goal of this work is to develop a multi-strain model for the population at risk from a single source (the SIS). This method can be used to estimate the prevalence or incidence rates of SIS by using an empirical data set that includes all individuals who have been diagnosed with SIS. The results are compared with those obtained from a multi-strain model developed previously. The proposed multi-strain model has several advantages over the existing models. First, it is applicable to any network structure where there is no explicit knowledge of the underlying disease process. Second, it is able to capture information about the distribution of the epidemic among individuals within the population. Third, it allows us to obtain estimates of the overall burden of SIs as well as their relative risks. Fourth, it provides a framework for studying the impact of different types of interventions on the spread of SIs. Finally, it enables us to compare the effectiveness of different interventions against one another.Q:

(SDEs) which describe how individuals change their behavior over time. These
models are often referred to as stochastic SIS epidemiological models. They were
first proposed by the authors of the seminal papers [1, 2] who studied the
diffusion process at large scales through Monte Carlo simulations. The
results obtained from these simulations showed that the diffusion processes
are more sensitive to changes in population size than other types of epidemic
models. The results presented here demonstrate that the SIS epidemiological
model can be successfully applied to study real world settings where there is
a strong dependence between population size and disease incidence.
In addition, the SIS epidemiological models provide a new approach to studying
the effects of climate change on human health. This application will allow us
to investigate whether climate change could affect the spread of infectious diseases
in humans.

","The epidemic spreading process is one of the most important processes in
social science and engineering. It is widely recognized that the spread of
epidemic diseases depends on the interaction between individuals and their
social networks. In this study, we develop two modeling approaches to
explore the effect of social network structure on the epidemic spreading
process. The first approach is based on the competitive dual-strain SIS
epidemiological model which considers the competition between susceptible
individuals and infected individuals. The second approach is based on the
competitive dual-strain SIS epidemiological model where the susceptible
individuals are aware of the infection status of the infected individuals.
Both approaches are validated through numerical simulations.","The aim of this study is to develop a competitive dual-strain SIS model for the
inference of the prevalence of COVID-19 in China, and to compare it with the
prevalence of other diseases in China. The model is based on an empirical
simulation of the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 in China. It is based on a
multivariate stochastic process with a time-varying covariance matrix. We
characterize the parameters of the model and the number of variables in the
model. Our results show that the model is more accurate than the previous
models in terms of the number of variables and the number of parameters. In
addition, we also find that the model is more accurate than the previous
solutions in terms of the number of variables and the number of parameters.
Finally, we discuss how our findings can be used as a reference for future
research.

The model is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) and solved using an interior point method. The model is applied to the study of the spread of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. The results show that the model can be used to predict the epidemic dynamics for a wide range of network structures and parameters.Q:

How to get the value of a variable in a function?

I have a function that takes a variable name and returns a variable value. I want to do this without using global variables. How would I do this?
function get_value(varname) {
    return varname;
}

A:

You can use the global keyword like this:
function get_value(varname) {
    return 'hello';
}

Or you can use the global keyword inside your function definition like this:
function get_value(varname) {
    return 'hello';
}

global = get_value;","In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model the spread of an epidemic through contact network data using competitive and stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The proposed framework is based on both individual level information about individuals' infection status as well as their interactions within social groups that are connected by contacts between them. We develop methods for estimating these parameters from observational studies such as surveys or laboratory experiments while accounting for unobserved heterogeneity across subjects due to differences in study design, sample size, survey questions used, etc., which can be incorporated into our methodologies via appropriate weighting functions. Our methodology allows us to incorporate any type of random effects at multiple levels including subject specific factors like age group, gender, disease severity, time since symptom onset, vaccination history, treatment received, household structure, community location, seasonality, mobility patterns, population density, socioeconomic characteristics, behavioral attributes, environmental conditions, demographic composition, socio demographics, geographical features, health system infrastructure, healthcare access, hospitalization rates, emergency department visits, deaths, infections caused by COVID 19 virus among others. In addition, it also provides flexibility regarding how many types of infectious agents should exist simultaneously during transmission processes so long as they have different infectivity values."
med,Inferring disease association using clinical factors in a combinatorial manner and their use in drug repositioning,"MOTIVATION: Complex physiological relationships exist among human diseases. Thus, the identification of disease associations could provide new methods of disease care and diagnosis. To this end, numerous studies have investigated disease associations. However, combinatorial effect of physiological factors, which is the main characteristic of biological systems, has not been considered in most previous studies.\RESULTS: In this study, we inferred disease associations with a novel approach that considered disease-related clinical factors in combinatorial ways by using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, and the results have been shown as disease networks. Here, the FP-growth algorithm, an association rule mining algorithm, was used to generate a clinical attribute combination profile of each disease. In addition, we characterized the 22 clinical risk attribute combinations frequently discovered from the 26 diseases in this study. Furthermore, we validated that the results of this study have great potential for drug repositioning and outperform other existing disease networks in this regard. Finally, we suggest a few disease pairs as new candidates for drug repositioning and provide the evidence of their associations from the literature.","Inferring disease association using clinical factors in a combination of the following:
[1] The number of patients with an underlying condition that is likely to be associated with a disease, such as cancer, heart disease, or diabetes mellitus.
[2] A diagnosis may be made by performing a test for any one of the following:
[3] An abnormal result from a laboratory assay;
[4] A patient's history indicating whether he or she has had treatment for his or her disease (e.g., chemotherapy);
[5] A symptom indicative of possible progression of chronic diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, or other conditions related to health care services;
[6] A medical history showing evidence of serious illness requiring hospitalization;
[7] A physical examination demonstrating signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome;
[8] A blood sample taken at least 1 hour after the onset of symptoms;
[9] A urine sample collected within 2 hours of the onset of symptoms;
[10] A chest X-ray performed immediately after the onset of symptoms;
[11] A computed tomography scan performed shortly after the onset of symptoms;
[12] A CT scan performed approximately 3 hours after the onset of symptoms;
","The application of the TDSR method to epidemiological data sets from patients who are known to have chronic diseases such as
diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, etc. provides new insights into how these conditions may affect health outcomes.
The TDSR method allows us to identify associations between two variables based on some common features like age, gender, race, ethnicity, marital status, etc. These characteristics could be useful indicators of risk behaviors associated with certain diseases.
The TDSR method uses a combination of statistical techniques to estimate parameters related to each variable. This approach enables one to obtain estimates of parameter values which are more accurate than those obtained by other approaches.
The TDSR method requires only three assumptions: i) there is no prior information about the patient's past history; ii) it is assumed that all possible combinations of covariates exist; iii) any given pair of independent variables exists; iv) if there is at least one non-zero coefficient vector corresponding to either diabetes type A or B, then the coefficients will be zero.
The TDSR method does not require knowledge of demographic statistics, but rather relies on mathematical models describing population structure and distribution. The TDSR method assumes that individuals' histories are well","Drug repositioning is a promising approach to discover new drugs from existing
drugs. The current challenge is to identify the most effective drug candidates
from a large number of candidate drugs. This task is challenging due to the
large number of possible combinations of drug molecules and the high
complexity of the underlying data. In this work, we propose a novel approach to
identify the most effective drug candidates based on the combination of
clinical features and their corresponding drug targets. We formulate the
combination of clinical features and drug targets as a combinatorial
inference problem and develop a novel algorithm to solve it. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through a case study of drug repositioning
using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset.","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 who were randomly assigned to receive either an intervention or control group. We also aimed to determine whether the patients were more likely to have received a treatment, as well as to assess the impact of the intervention on the disease burden. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 598 patients were enrolled in our cohort. Of these, 449 (45%) had received a treatment, while 621 (60%) had not. Patients were divided into two groups based on their disease status: those who received a treatment and those who did not. In addition, we compared the clinical features between the two groups. Results: Compared with the control group, the patients in the intervention group had significantly lower levels of CD4+ T-cell count (p < 0.001), higher levels of IL-17A (p = 0.002) and higher levels of IFN-γ (p = 0.003). There was no significant difference in the levels of other inflammatory markers between the two groups. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the patients in the intervention group had a higher level of CD4+ T.","The aim of this study was to infer the association between the clinical features of patients with cancer and the drug response. We used a combinatorial approach that included clinical data from the literature, as well as information on the drug's mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. We then used these data to infer the association between the clinical features and the drug efficacy. The results showed that the combination of clinical features and drug mechanisms can be used to infer the association between the clinical features and drug efficacy. This approach may be useful for drug repositioning studies.Q:

In this study we propose an approach to infer associations between two or more conditions based on patient characteristics (clinical features) that can be used as input data of machine learning models trained with these inputs. We show how such approaches could improve prediction performance by combining information from multiple sources including genetic variants associated with both phenotypes; however they also allow us to identify new potential targets for treatment development. The proposed method is applied to predict whether patients will develop Alzheimer's Disease after receiving one dose of memantine hydrochloride at least once during life. Our results indicate improved accuracy compared to previous methods which only consider single-drug exposures while ignoring other possible interactions among them. This work provides insights into developing personalized medicine through integrating heterogeneous datasets containing different types of genomic variation across individuals. It shows promise towards improving precision medicines and identifying novel therapeutic agents. Furthermore it suggests ways forward toward personalizing treatments for individualized health management strategies. Finally our findings suggest directions for future research focusing on incorporating genomics knowledge in combination with traditional epidemiological studies when designing interventions aimed at reducing risk of adverse outcomes related to exposure to certain medications. Such integration would help reduce costs and increase efficiency in healthcare systems worldwide."
med,Blending Low-Frequency Vibrations and Push-pull Effects Affords Superior Photoacoustic Imaging Agents.,"Photoacoustic imaging (PAI), a state-of-the-art noninvasive in vivo imaging technique, has been widely used in clinical disease diagnosis. However, the design of high-performance PAI agents with three key characteristics, i.e., near-infrared (NIR) absorption (λabs > 800 nm), intense PA signals, and excellent photostability, remains a challenging goal. Herein, we present a facile but effective approach for engineering PAI agents by amplifying intramolecular low-frequency vibrations and enhancing the push-pull effect. As a demonstration of this blended approach, we constructed a PAI agent (BDP1-NEt2) based on the boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) scaffold. Compared with indocyanine green (ICG, an FDA-approved organic dye widely utilized in PAI studies; λabs = 788 nm), BDP1-NEt2 exhibited a UV-Vis-NIR spectrum peaked at 825 nm, superior in vivo PA signal intensity and outstanding stability to offer improved tumor diagnostics. We believe this work provides a promising strategy to develop the next generation of PAI agents.","The photoacoustic imaging agents (PIA) are a class of optical sensors that can be used to image the surface acoustic wave (SAW) in an object, such as a human body or a computer screen. The PIA is typically composed of two components: a photoelectric sensor and a photoelectrode. The photoelectric sensor includes a photoelectric transducer which converts light into electrical signals, and the photoelectrode includes a photoelectric transducer which converts electric signals from the photoelectric transducer into electrical signals. The signal output from the photoelectric sensor is amplified by a photoelectric amplifier, which amplifies the input signal with a voltage proportional to the amplitude of the reflected light. The photoelectrode also includes a photoelectric transducer which converts electric signals from the photoelectric transducer into electrical signals. The electrochemical reaction between the photoelectric transducer and the photoelectrode generates chemical reactions within the photosensitive material. These chemical reactions include oxidation, reduction, dehydration, condensation, etc. The photoelectric response depends on the composition of the materials being imaged. For example, the photoelectric response may depend on the composition of the materials being imaged. In addition, the charge transfer properties of","The high-frequency vibrating band (HFVB) approach provides a powerful tool
for imaging agents such as radar systems, laser sources, and other
radar systems. It allows us to study the effects of vibration on acoustic
imaging agents without resorting to any mechanical means. This technique
has recently been applied to image agents including radar systems, laser
source devices, and other types of optical sensors.
In this paper, we apply the HFVB approach to image agents which are
limited to low-frequency vibrating bands. We demonstrate that our method
can be extended to more complex vibrating bands.
We use the HFVB approach to generate images of various types from
the ground up. These images are then processed through a variety of
methods to obtain detailed information about the agent's motion.
This paper describes the HFVB method based on the DFT method.
Methods:
1.  A simple wavelet transform algorithm is used to transform each
   element of the wavelet space onto a discrete Fourier transform
   basis. The resulting representation is called a wavelet basis.
2.  Two different wavelet basis functions are constructed so that they
   represent two distinct frequencies. The frequency components","Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a noninvasive imaging modality that uses
ultrasound waves to generate images of tissue properties. The technique relies
on the interaction of ultrasound waves with water molecules in tissues. The
photoacoustic effect occurs when the ultrasound waves are absorbed by the
water molecules and converted into heat energy. The resulting heat signal is
detected by a detector and converted into an image. The photoacoustic effect
is particularly useful in the detection of tumors because it is sensitive to
the presence of blood vessels.
In this work, we investigate the use of low-frequency vibrations to enhance
the photoacoustic effect. We demonstrate that the photoacoustic effect can be
enhanced by the addition of low-frequency vibrations. We further explore the
usefulness of the photoacoustic effect in the detection of tumors.","The use of low-frequency vibrational waves to image the surface of a
surface-sensitive material has been studied extensively in the past few years.
However, the high-fidelity nature of these waves makes them difficult to
implement in a single imaging agent. In this paper we present an approach to
the problem of designing low-fidelity vibrational waves that can be used to
image the surface of a surface-sensitive material. We propose two novel
applications: (i) a method for the generation of low-fidelity vibrational
waves by using a laser beam with a frequency close to the resonance frequency of
a surface-sensitive material, and (ii) a method for the generation of low-fid
vibration waves by using a laser beam with a frequency near the resonance frequency
of a surface-sensitive material. The method is based on the use of a
laser beam with a frequency close to the resonance frequency of a surface-sensitive
material. Our results show that the method can be used to image the surface of a
solution-free surface-sensitive material, and that it can be used to image the
surfaces of a surface-sensitive material.
","The development of photoacoustic imaging agents with high sensitivity, selectivity, and specificity is a major challenge in the field of biomedical imaging. In this study, we report the synthesis of a series of novel photoacoustic imaging agents based on the combination of a low-frequency vibrational mode and a push-pull effect. The synthesized compounds were characterized by spectroscopic methods, and their photophysical properties were investigated using UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. We found that the introduction of a push-pull effect into the photoacoustic imaging agents can significantly improve their photostability and photochemical stability. Furthermore, the photoacoustic imaging agents based on the combination of a low-frequency vibrational mode and a push-pull effect exhibited superior photoacoustic imaging performance compared to those based on the combination of a low-frequency vibrational mode and a push-push effect.Q:

How to get the value of an element in a list?

I have a list of elements like this:

I want to get the value of the element 1 (the first element) but I don't know how to do                                                                                                                                                                                           ","Photoacoustics is a promising technique for imaging biological tissues, but the high frequency components of photoacoustic signals are usually masked by other ultrasound sources such as blood pulsation or cardiac activity in clinical applications. Herein we report on an approach to enhance low-frequency (LF) acoustic waves through blending them with higher frequencies via push-pull effects between two different types of piezo transducers: one type acts like conventional LF probes while another can be used as ultrahigh sensitivity pressure sensors that enable simultaneous monitoring both LFs and their harmonics at ultrasonic fields up to 1 MHz. The proposed method allows us to obtain highly resolved images from single cells without any sample preparation using only standard microscopy equipment. We demonstrate this novel strategy on live cell micro-imaging experiments where it enables visualization of individual mitochondria within living cancerous tumor samples under near infrared excitation conditions. Our results show excellent performance compared against state-of-the-art methods including confocal fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, which has been previously shown to suffer severe limitations due to its poor signal/noise ratio when combined with traditional optical techniques. This work provides new opportunities towards biomedical research involving nonlinear optics and optoelectronics based approaches."
